Hmmm,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Hmmm, I’m a member and great chopper from Nike, because am a student I always call for student discount before I get products so today I phoned for student discount and the representative to me that I was given discount in December and January so she can’t give me student discount cause am spending too much. Can you imagine they are supposed to be happy shopping with them but they are not happy about it, have you seen this kind before?
REFUND ISSUE,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Hello,I had returned a product and it has been more than 4 Months and I still have not received my refund, even after repeated reminders. Did not expect this from a company like NIKE. Details are given below. I have been writing to u guys for the last 4 months, but no one is bothered to solve this issue. Brilliant customer service.ORDER NO	:     G10091529199 (29th OCT 2022)
Beware Evri (Hermes),Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Miserable time actually trying to receive my order. Nike have decided making a quick buck is more important to them than good customer experience. Please Nike, stop using Evri and use a proper delivery service.
Shocking customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Shocking customer service - I cannot believe the lies, fob offs, calls hung up from this huge company ! Totally shocked to read so many poor reviews. How can they get away with treating customers so poorly. Awful to deal with - lies about refunds, no calls back - I’ve called weekly now for over 12 weeks ! Something needs to be done about this.
Stop using UPS in Sweden,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Stop using UPS in Sweden. They never try to deliver the parcel to your home. Everytime they claim your wasn’t home so they delivered to the pick-up point instead. Since the introduction of home office, I’ve seen through that lie. That together with useless support from Nike customer servers sets the grade.
Nike does not care about scams,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike does not care about helping you out of a scam. I was told I was out of luck because even though I had the $500 card canceled immediately after purchase, they said a purchase was made. They did not track down the person who supposedly bought something. They were also unable to reissue me a new card. Think twice before giving them your business.
Nike do not check their emails!,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Nike do not check their emails, i was sent a survey regarding Jordan 1's that i bought, decided to answer the survey and emailed them about the sizing problem i had not been given a reply back ever since, terrible expirience!
Advertised pictures are deceiving,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Ordered an expensive custom design boot. They falsely advertise in pictures a black shoe lace on the boot and when delivered it was navy. I raised with them and they give you the same speech as most call centers, a total run around instead of fixing and replacing. They then use blaming of computers and quality of picture as their excuse so be careful to order and check that you get what you understand in their descriptions rather than thinking the pictures they advertise is what you will get.
Is it legal???,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Not sure how they illegally operate their website.Website is having hiccups.No cancellation remark about their 30 minutes cancellation window unless you try to search for it, which is not clear and not any merchandise standards.Chat and phonecalls are of no help.
peeling off in the front and back.,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I have a metcon that is super new, but it is peeling off in the front and back. This shoe gets only 3 years , it was expensive, as are all Nike shoes. They said they can only do something when shoes is 02 years old.
So the scammers who ripped my bro,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,So the scammers who ripped my brother off earlier bought their stuff at online at Nike and Nike won’t stop the order, everyone else they ordered stuff off said ‘not a problem’ and cancelled their orders, Nike however said after 12 calls and 4hrs of stress ‘that’s not our policy’ and refused to do anything, screw you Nike!
I had to return shoes and the lady…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I had to return shoes and the lady checked my states and returned my shoes and  she asked me do I want to write a review, I said okay then she said  let me scan on your phone, I gave her my phone then she scanned it and she started review without my notification and gave to me the phone,  that was unfair and uncritical
Terrible service and zero empathy given,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Exactly the same experience as many others, Product ordered not arrived “lost in transit” when I reached out, no proactive approach from Nike. I went back they tried a refund which is not what I wanted, I was promised a new item would be sent. I then received confirmation of delivery… still no item. Still no proactive measures from Nike. Reach out again. They are happy to refund me… this is the absolute minimum this company could do without literally stealing my money they had for 2 months. Won’t be buying again, app deleted bring on the disrupters!
Best Brand,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Trust company with all kind of styles of snickers to many sports. For me is my favorite brand of shoes. Special in all retro styles have now.
Nike claim - poor service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Returned faulty shoes in November. I was told on 5th January that they had been inspected and a egift card would be issued within 7 days. We are now 21 days later and customer service keep fobbing me off.  Can’t make a complaint, can’t email anyone. The online chat people keep ending the chat. Poor service
Go through your bank and ask for a  charge back,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Effectively Nike use a call centre to process there complaints and returns and they are just given a Script and probably have nothing to do with Nike itself. I purchased a pair of trainers that fell apart after first use so I contacted them via chat as that is all you can do I was then told I could return them as they were faulty. I was sent a prepaid Royal Mail return label and sent it I then waited 5 days checked the tracking and it said it was delivered they then contacted me and said I sent an empty box which is a complete lie as I have the weight on the receipt which I sent to them and they didn’t respond I then contacted them again and they said there’s nothing they can do and won’t send a refund. So effectively they now have my trainers I sent they have refused me a refund and have called my a lier. I contacted my bank and they said it’s something they can do and are issuing a charge back on my transaction. I recommend doing this if you want your money back I hope this helps. Also it’s pretty easy to report them to trading standard too.
Package undelivered,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I received an email saying my order was delivered, but I did not receive it.When checking the delivery image that DPD sent through, it shows an image of a package in the drivers hand in the street. I went to nike.com to get an update/information on my package, but was unable to find an email address to rectify this issue.I'd be most grateful if someone would respond to me with an update on the whereabouts of my package ASAP.
I placed an order and am waiting to…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I placed an order and am waiting to receive it. In two days I want to order more and find out that my account is blocked!Communication with the support service did not solve anything. They say my account is blocked for security reasons.What security. I am a registered customer, I want to make and pay for my order and I can't!This is the worst service ever!
Customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I already submitted a review about Nike and I would like to mention that I have used their chat service a few times but they always say we are sorry that you are unable to access the app membership site and we will look into it but they never do. Why do they always put high top trainers on the membership only site it is unfair especially when it is so difficult to get air force or Jordan high tops anywhere else and some of those other sites are dodgy. They are Just going to lose out on sales if they don't sort this out.If I had wanted low trainers I would have bought low trainers but I don't
contacted them through their CHAT,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,contacted them through their CHAT very quick and they change my shoes directly was very happy
Used their app,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Used their app, awful service, take forever to ship out your items. Do not order from the app. I got one item the day after I ordered but the second part of my item hasn’t even shipped two weeks later. Contacted them and they said oh well we can’t cancel it even though we haven’t even bothered to send it but you can just refuse it when the order comes…worst app ever
I would rate this company a zero if I…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I would rate this company a zero if I could. I purchased a Nike tech fleece jacket from JD , instead of going to JD I went to NIKE (big mistake of mine) and opened a dispute in October 2022. However, NIKE said they spoke to JD and admitted over the phone it was a faulty batch they had sent to JD. They requested I send the jacket back, which I did in exchange for e-giftcard. It’s been nearly 5 months , no refund or e-giftcard. Nike customer service have been fobbing me off. They stole the jacket off us and won’t even return it back to us. EXTREMELY POOR customer service. Worst company. Considering it’s so big you would expect better service. DO NOT OPEN DISPUTES WITH NIKE. They steal your item and won’t compensate you with the refund. No idea how to contact someone and complain either. Very very frustrating and poor.
My husband got a gift card for Christmas,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My husband got a gift card for Christmas. He ordered shoes online. We used the gift card and when checking out it said gift card -100.00. When we finished checking out it never took the gift card off. I called customer service and spoke to Christopher. He said he would put the $100.00 back in my account. He LIED!!! He never put it back. Very poor customer service and we will never order from here again. THANK YOU FOR NOTHING CHRISTOPHER AND NIKE!!!
chinese order instead of shoes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,my shoes arrived at my house and the box was nike. But when i opened the box a big plastic container was full of boiled rice and some prawn crackers. got to sort it out and give me my shoes. rubish
If I.could take zero stars i would,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could rate zero stars i would. In 25 years of ordering online this is THE WORST COMPANY I've ever had the displeasure to deal with. I so wish I had read the reviews beforehand as they're disgraceful.  Ordered a football on 10th December and paid £23. It was "dispatched" a week later. I then received an email to say DPD had it. Then when I tracked it all it kept says was "there's been an exception on your parcel" now today 6 weeks later its saying "parcel on way back to sender" If Nike do not refund me by close of play this week I'm going to file a claim at the small claims court. Robbing thieving company. DO NOT ORDER
Awful chat service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful. Ordered trial shoes and 3 months later started falling apart. Messaged Nike 9am it’s now after 4,15pm and the matter still isn’t resolved. They want me to return the items but require me to find a way to print the label and even then; from others; it seems you send shoes back and get nothing back in return. Not risking having paid a fortune for trainers and having nothing. Moreso I don’t use email often nor do I have a printer so they’re telling me tuff - so basically if you can’t print to return bad goods the warranty doesn’t apply to you. Mariana was useless and repeated same thing over and over on chat despite my msgs which she ignored. Chat is awful; 8 hours and 4 different people and still nothing. STEER CLEAR.
This idea of being selected to buy…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This idea of being selected to buy shoes namely Dunks is not working all the sharks buy them and triple the cost , get a grip make a shoe advertise it and sell as usual for the right price first come first served
Where is my ordered trainers 🤨 ordered 03/01/23 & today 22/01/23 STILL not received 😶,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Made an order 03/01/23 & continually states ‘awaiting courier collection to date 22/01/23’. I have rang customer services ..  I may as well speak to a wall! Customer service is diabolical & claim my orders been dispatched 😂 even when it still shows as ‘waiting courier collection?!’ Could not make this 💩 up. I have sent several emails (replies) to an email that I was sent via customer service to be able to reply to , to make a complaint But I have not received any acknowledgment (as most big companies do?) let alone a reply so thinking this is an email address that no-one reads/follows up!? Avoid ordering via Nike & use other options to place your orders.
Two months after placing the order no delivery,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Two months after placing the order, when I queried about the shipment of my purchases, I have been notified, products are not available and being advised that, purchased amount will be refunded in days. If products are not available, why they made me wait two months? Not a acceptable solution.
Nike. You have lost a customer!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The website is so hard to navigate, as a 35 year old man, aware of todays technology I think it should be easy to use. I couldn't find where my basket was.
Do not order from this site,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Do not order from this site. The shoes were very cheap looking with cheap plastic and glue everywhere. The shoes were just thrown in a box. This is the second pair that I received liked this. Horrible quality.
Nike are a bit of a hit and miss with…,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Nike are a bit of a hit and miss with their service that includes their SNKRS app and the Nike app many times I’ve won raffles and draws only for items to be lost in transit or lost before they’ve even left the warehouse Nike doesn’t seem to care at all infact they even use Evri to deliver their items who are possibly the worst company in terms of delivering personally going forward I’ll try and give secondary retailers a chance
Nike Court Vision Mid,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Ordered 24th received on 26th Happy with my delivery was double boxed and not damaged. Retro Nike Court Vision boots 80s style.Thank you. NIKE
I bought a hoodie from a Nike store in…,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,I bought a hoodie from a Nike store in London last year and it’s great. Excellent design, very nice fabric and in the store they helped me choose a hoodie in my size. For a year of use I’m happy with everything, but honestly it’s a little expensive. In all at her aspects, I can say that Nike hoodies are excellent buy
Ordered shows which did not arrive for…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered shows which did not arrive for 2 weeks. They offered a refund and a discount so that I could repurchase the shoes at a discounted rate… the discount is not valid on those shoes I originally purchased- so to obtain the compensation for Nikes error, I have to buy shoes I do not want?!
All I can say is that it is overpriced…,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,All I can say is that it is overpriced for the quality it advertises.
Come on u guys need to make ur…,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Come on u guys need to make ur basketball shoes strong enough for both outdoors and indoors
No more nike products for me,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No more nike products for me. The worst service on the planet by far. Nike employee stole my gift card issued during a return.
Nike should stand behind their…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike should stand behind their products, especially when their products are not cheap.  Customer service is very poor.  I personally would not shop at Nike because their customer service is outrageous.
Another person who wished they read the…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Another person who wished they read the reviews before purchasing … Evri is their courier… need I say more?! Apparently they couldn’t deliver my parcel because of “bad weather” (despite it being sunshine) and I’ve been waiting since Tuesday with no hope of ever receiving it. Trying to get a refund is also a minefield… we shall see if it ever goes back to my bank account! Awful service very disappointed and will never purchase from Nike online again
Totally wasted my time on the…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Totally wasted my time on the experiences. It is a phony lie. The website focus group crashed and they would not pay the promised compensation. Total horrible experience!
AF1 came in terrible shape,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered a pair of AF1 from nike. They came in terrible shape. Unremovable Glue all over the shoes, black stains especially around the soles and dirty laces. I paid 170 Swiss Francs btw. Don't be like me and just open the package! Make sure you have a camera filming how you open and examin the shoes so you can give them back without issues.
Scam!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I had an order, I received it, the product looks horrible, you say it's a replica. I made the return request on 28.12.2022 and so far nothing has happened! Poor service!
1.Impossible to get in touch with…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,1.Impossible to get in touch with customer support2. have a case of broken shoes and they have used months to fix it, and still nothing. No info, no shoes, no nothing3. useless customer service
Absolutely shocking,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely shocking. Ordered a pair of trainers in time for Christmas that I never received, Nike kept on changing the delivery day every day. If I didn't get in contact they would of allowed it to continue. Nike experts on the app are as much use as a chocolate teapot, glitchy system, was told they do not have a complaints dept. A manager was supposed to call me back on 2 occasions. I never received a call. Rang a Nike number from a Google search and finally got a full refund. A disgusting customer service experience, I will never purchase anything from Nike again
I really like Nike sport outfits but…,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,I really like Nike sport outfits but custom servise is so and so. IMO, much more convenient to buy Nike in retail stores.
Rubbish service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Rubbish service, products expensive and can be really rubbish Nike 270s the writing peeling off the pull tab at the back, my air max 90s a strange hard lub in the back of the heel made them so uncomfortable, when contacting Nike it was just send them back and we will refund-no replacement which I wanted!
Rubbish service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered some trainers just after Xmas in the sales at the site stated a week later that the carrier hadn’t collected them, then when I contacted them they said delivery was attempted twice no one home even though I’ve been off work at home and have safe place and neighbours said cards left but not got them, said will have to have refund as none available and carrier is returning the original ones I’m disgusted rubbish service won’t use again
Rediculous service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ridiculous customer service. The customer service team can't issue a refund. I've called 3X times (Dec 23rd, Dec 28th, now Jan 5) and they keep "escalating" but nobody ever called me back from "higher management". My order is still not arrived, totally missed Christmas for my son, and it's been 5 weeks. This is ridiculous, I'm telling everyone never to shop Nike.com and switching to Under Armor.
Order never delivered,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I placed an order and waited for delivery, I was then notified that a refund would be issued on the order. I called the customer care team who could not explain why this happened and could not reissue the order even though the tracking shows the items are ready for delivery.I have never dealt with a customer care team that is so incompetent, I will never order from Nike again.
I ordered some trainers while on…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered some trainers while on holiday in Ireland 2 weeks ago . They were ordered on line to come to our address in the uk . Really Nice trainers however I wish i could say the same about the delivery shocking !!! I was charged for the trainers and they were ordered on the 29th December . I was told Delivery would be on the 5th of January 2023 I waited in all day no sign of trainers , Last night I recieved a refund of the money !!! Real shame my company was going to place many orders .
Total CONMEN,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Total CONMEN. Told me that my order had been sent when in reality courier had not even collected it, I rang 6 days ago and was given the bums rush, made complaint and was promised a manager call back. This like my order has never arrived
The incompetence of both service agents…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The incompetence of both service agents I spoke too was almost unbelievable. Trying to return a gift that was given to me was nigh on impossible, due to their lack of understanding at how I wouldn't have personal details of the person sending said gift. I would have been happy to send the trainers back and simply recieved a gift card. Order number, email were both presented along with mobile number and still they couldn't help.
Received wrong size shoe on a Nike…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Received wrong size shoe on a Nike website order, returned to store and they refunded the money to a gift card and placed another order for correct size shoe. Nike cancelled the order due to shoe not available and did not notify me about the cancelled order. I found out after I called to see the status of the order. I asked for a refund and they told me to go back to the store and that they would refund the money back to a gift card, went to the store as instructed and the store told me they cannot do that. they told me to call customer service back, I did call customer service from the store and the runaround started. Nike customer service said that they could not do an immediate refund and said the the order was going to review panel and it would take at  least 7 business days. Nike was quick to charge my credit  card for the purchase  but when is time for a refund on an order that they cancelled, good luck to you. There customer service is terrible, employees are not trained how to deal with customers. Horrible experience, still waiting on my refund.
I wish I’d read all these reviews a lot…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I wish I’d read all these reviews a lot earlier. I, like many others ordered Nike Gift cards for our children for Christmas. I placed the order via the Nike app on the 18th December: 2 gift cards for 100 euros each. We’re still waiting for them with no update in the app apart from ‘Preparing for shipment’. Nike is unable to cancel the order and give me my money back. I’m astounded that a company like Nike does not have an adequate infrastructure nor technology platform in place to offer at least a minimum of acceptable service.
If I could give zero starts I would ..,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could give zero starts I would ... tried to order a pair of jogging bottoms tonight using nike online .. TWICE it took the payment out of my account and didn't complete the order ... so I have two payments pending for an order I couldn't complete .... AVOID AT ALL COSTS
fast shipment,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I just got a parcel from nike.com and I must say that the delivery time was really short, the parcel came really quickly.
Worst expirence for years,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst expirence for years. Ordered on 12/6 for Christmas. 2 days later I get an email saying my order ha been delayed. Then nothing. Everytime I contacted them, they said I'd get the shoes 12/23 bit could never give me tracking information. I've now asked for a refund as the order is still showing delayed. Now told I need to wait 5 days for an email to start the refund? Such a scam, will never shop Nike ever again
So excited that I finally won a draw on…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,So excited that I finally won a draw on the SNKRS app. I have been getting up at 6am for all of the draws. Only to find out later that day that my order was cancelled. The shoes were up on the website for sale to general public for a few hours before selling out. What a waste of time and I can't believe Nike and the lack of answers. I followed up only to be brushed off not once but twice.So disappointing
If I could give this company a minus I…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could give this company a minus I would. Looking at all other reviews I so wish I had checked this website out first before placing an order.  All I wanted was a voucher to be delivered on time and before Xmas. You can not hold a decent conversation with anyone in the company. I have now resorted to sending a message on twitter. My next step will be to raise an issue with trading standards as this company is incompetent to carry out basic customer service.    My list is so long of complaints that I won’t include them here. Do not order anything from this company. They are one of the worse companies I have ever dealt with.
Order on way 😂,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Order on way. 14 days later dpd not received order and nike customer service just give me bluff. Expected delivery date keeps changing. Never again, will stick with adidas direct.
Do not buy online from Nike,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Do not buy online from Nike. I ordered 2 shoes...one arrived in a decent time, but the second has yet to come after over a month. They have not clue where this second pair is... fedex says it was shipped to a US address. Most agents speak broken english and for sure do not know what is going on... I have now called about 5 times. Never again......still do not have the shoes.
Frustrated father/man,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,As a father/man I am only familiar with regular size S,M, L etc. Feeling frustrated that I came home where my wife told me they also have M tall etc. Ridiculous that a company thinks it serves a purpose by introducing custom sizes...never Nike again.
Incredibly satisfied!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,before I bought I checked trustpilot, despite all the negative reviews I ordered the shoes, they arrived in 3 days! I am incredibly satisfied!
Good quality product,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Good quality product, fast delivery
Awful company,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful company. Ordered expensive trainers for Christmas present. Turns out they sent a far cheaper pair. Phoned customer services. Not great have to wait until we see proper trainers back on their on line store then contact them again to organise replacement. On returns told would need to join their on line club to qualify for free returns!! Not happening their mistake. Saga continues with onus on customer. Very poor.
Got sent a wrong pair of shoes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Got sent a wrong pair of shoes. Sent them back via the app. A drop down menu just gives you instructions how to return but nothing about taking pictures of the wrong item. 2 weeks later the refuse to refund me as no proof of wrong shoe, even though they said a wrong item was sent back….also said if the cannot find what I sent back at the warehouse then that’s all they can do. So no refund and no shoe. Checked all the FAQ for this process of taking a picture and it does not seem like it’s on the website or app. I eithe just want the correct shoe or a refund. Awful after being a long standing Nike customer.
Terrible website and app experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible website and app experience. Unhelpful customer service. Have tried multiple times to place an order with Nike but just keep getting an error code. Followed the instructions given by the customer service agent who obviously fields the same calls all day and knows full well what she’s advising won’t work. It didn’t. Phoned back and was told it was my fault for using the website and I should download the app! Didn’t really want the app but downloaded it so that I could order a specific football shirt as a present. The app doesn’t work either, just get another error code. Nike clearly don’t care about customer satisfaction as there are numerous reviews of people saying the same thing yet nothing is being done by Nike to improve the situation and, rather than apologise for the inconvenience, customer services scold you for having the audacity to try and spend your hard earned money with them!
It’s ok,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Nike tech is very good but the delivery sucks and could improve.
Very bad cutomer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After being a loyal and member of nike for several years, I have to say I am very disappointed by the customer service provided. I ordered a pair of trainers online, and the delivery provider failed to deliver the parcel on a number of occasions a side from the delivery company 's very poor service, what is shocking is that Nike UK would not take my complaints seriously or even trying to get the issue resolved! So I have asked for a refund of the purchase which they refused, and have ridiculously suggested that I have to first get the delivery first before I can get a refund. So far I don't have the product or the refund, so I had to go through my bank to dispute the order on my behalf.
Pllleeease stop using Evri to send my…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Pllleeease stop using Evri to send my parcels. I buy from Nike a lot as I have a trainer business and it always used to be DPD. But now you’re using Evri, my parcels get dumped on my doorstep, some have gone missing, a few have got lost in transit and even with next day delivery they NEVER deliver on time. Gonna have to start using elsewhere for my products at this rate. Please at least give us the option to not have Evri deliver!
Would be zero stars if could,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Would be zero stars if could! Ordered a gift voucher online almost two weeks ago as a christmas present, meant to be delivered by 19th, still no sign, ring up, rude customer service, hasn’t been sent because and I quote “a plastic deficiency “ within the company… I hadn’t been notified of this delay and offered no alternative but to wait for there to be plastic for cards… ridiculous from supposedly one of the biggest companies in the world
Worst customer service ever,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst customer service ever. Ordered goods on 8th December - should have been plenty of time for Christmas. Hadn't received by 16th so contacted 'Ruben' on live chat. Was advised that the goods were damaged in transit so returned to Nike. No one obviously thought to let me know!!! Ruben reordered and advised I'd get them within 2-4 days. When they didn't arrive I contacted them again. Was advised that Ruben didn't tell me the truth and in fact they could take up to 9 days. It's now 28th and I still don't have my goods. No one from Nike has contacted me and they have ruined a child's Christmas
Best sportswear,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Best sportswear. Compared to all other commercial brand, its honestly the one with the best quality products. Pricing might be a bit down.
AWFUL… Ordered FOUR weeks ago and item…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AWFUL… Ordered FOUR weeks ago and item still hasn’t turned up. Was told a replacement would be sent. Still not sent. Then this evening after speaking on chat I was told that it’s gone to ‘our tool to be investigated’. Really?!?! JUST REFUND ME!!! Absolutely appalling customer service and I can hand on heart say I will never be ordering again as this is the second time this has happened to me.
My order arrived incorrect,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My order arrived. The incorrect size in the correct size box. It is now a month later, 3 days before Christmas & I still haven’t got my replacement. I have contacted via online chat & phone 5 times. If your order is correct I find Nike good but any issues are so difficult to resolve common with them is not good.

NIKE likes to claim they are…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,NIKE likes to claim they are environmentally conscious but a shipment I recently order travelled from the Netherlands, to Germany, then onto Belgium, then France, then to the USA before finally arriving in Canada. This is obviously not very environmentally friendly. Very disappointing! This will be my last order with Nike unless they improve their processes.
Limited stock. Poor website.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Website is v poor. Logged in as member to queue for new release at 8am. Placed order and excepted only to be told couldn't verify credit card, even though card had been stored as member details. Shoes then sold out. Agree with previous comments about money making, limited stock and fuelling the re-sale market. V disappointing.
Good quality,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,A few day ago I went to JD in the Croydon to buy same shoes. I found nice and quality shoes. Thanks to Joe who  helped me  to find nice and quality shoes
Nike doesn't honor its exchange policy,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,They don't honor their return and exchange policy. I shipped back an item after calling in and being told it would be exchanged for a smaller size. After they received the item from me, they instead refunded me my money and told me to rebuy the item which is now much more expensive that the sale ended. After several calls and chats with unhelpful and rude customer service reps I'm giving up.Nike wasted my time and money - all they had to do was send me a replacement and they would have made money. Now they get $0 from me and I will avoid ordering from their site moving forward - great job Nike.
I like the nike app but plz fix the snkrs app,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I like the nike app but the fkn snkrs app is so bad.I would have participated in a raffle and I was right on time at 9 for the travis's. but didn't even get the opportunity to participate in the raffle it kept saying that there is to many trying to pay with card. I know there's a small chance I'll get the shoes, but I certainly won't get them now. so love the nike app hate the snkrs app
How can a premium brand like Nike use…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,How can a premium brand like Nike use the worst courier service in the UK. Shocking ruining christmases all over the place. Evri are a joke and should not be used by any reputable business, totally unreliable and a premium rate number of you want to call them to find out where your parcel is!
Returns is a joke no refund even when tracked,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Really bad experience, sent back products and tracking says arrived 8th December. Even though items where tracked refunds for some in the same shipment and not all!!! So far waiting for €150 worth to be refunded. I'm baffled how they can process one box of returns and only refund partially.
AVOID,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely awful, order never arrived, problems with courier, then had to speak with 5 different customer service agents for updates and in the end gave up, demanded to get a refund, don't waste your time using Nike.com, shop elsewhere, you will save a lot of time dealing with incompetent customer services when something goes wrong, and it will go wrong, trust me, an ex Nike Member.
Horrible customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Horrible customer service. Ordered a pair of shorts over two weeks ago. They never shipped. I called and was told I had to wait until after the expected ship date in order for them to resolve the issue. I waited then I called and I was told that they rescheduled the ship date, as of today, nothing has been shipped. Could not get a supervisor to speak to me on the phone. Looks like I’ll be switching to under armor.
0 stars,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,0 stars. Ordered a gift card a week ago and order status is stuck in “preparing”. No way I will get this in time for Christmas now. One very disappointed grandchild on Christmas Day and Nike won’t cancel order nor tell me how long I will have to wait. Won’t be doing that again
Wow Nike, you’ve outdone yourselves yet again,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wow, just wow! Ordered a tracksuit for my son for xmas. Was impressed with it arriving so quick only to be bitterly disappointed that what I actually received was a mens tshirt! How hard can it be to pack these items? Clearly someone wasn’t taking any notice when this order was packed. Now have to go out of my way to send it back, with no drop off points close to me and wait god knows how long for a refund. Oh and now my son won’t have his most wanted xmas present. So thanks Nike! I’m going to be out of pocket and have one unhappy son.
Customer Service that doesn't really care. Just Dont Do It.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Unfortunately their courier messed up an order I placed on the 6th of December and by way of compensation I was promised free expedited delivery and a 20% discount. But none of the codes given to me actually work.I have had no satisfaction in trying to resolve this so far. I was feeling charitable and thought Id give Nike a second chance but right now I'm wishing I hadn't bothered.I'm still waiting on a refund too
Nike stole my shirt,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike stole my shirt. I ironed it as per the instructions on the label, but the shirt got burn marks. Customers service told me to return it and they would reach out within 5-7 days. It's been over a month and I haven't heard back from them. They don't respond to my emails either.
Would be 0 or minus,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 4 pairs for trainers and some clothes for my kids, the order arrived within 5 days but only half the order was delivered! I used web chat only to be told they can’t re-ship items and they can’t issue a refund until they have investigated (3 - 5 business days) I was told I could collect from a store but the nearest one is 50 miles away and I would have to pay again for the items! It’s 20/12/22 so I doubt I will hear anything before Christmas now……kids won’t have some of there Christmas gifts and I’m over £500 down. Thanks Nike and happy Christmas
Nike have become lazy and complacent,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike have become lazy and complacent. Their website and apps are in a disgraceful state of repair. They can't even manage real-time stock! This is a 45 billion dollar company people...They also fuel the black market by doing limited runs. Now most "Nike" products, especially "Jordan" are reproductions and the market is flooded with scammers and fake items. Nike encourages this through their anti-human business policies. This is no longer the famous brand it was, it is just a money vacuum now. Avoid!
I will give starts in minus if there…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I will give starts in minus if there can be the option. I purchased one pair of shoes and  firstly they rejected it by saying that your delivery address didn't match with kyc. Ok thats fine but now from ta last 30 days i am struggling for my refund. No one is listening to me. Please never buy anything from nike

Refund system not fit for purpose,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Returned poorly fitting top for a refund. Despite proof that Nike received it 10 working days ago on Yodel app via Nike return system they deny receipt and insist that until receipt they cant refund and even then it will be weeks away. Waste of time phoning them, recommend seek refund via Credit Card Provider
Well I’m giving a 5 star as I love Nike…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Well I’m giving a 5 star as I love Nike products from shoes to hat from socks to hoodies I love them all customer services is lovely and everything els BUT I’ve been entering raffles on SNKRS and unfortunately for the past 4 years I have never won one item and seems really upsetting for Nike to do something like this
48 Hour Delivery (Day 6),Rated 1 out of 5 stars,48 Hour Delivery, cost more but should arrive by Friday 16th December, so easily in time for Xmas.  WRONG!  16 Updates from DPD, my parcel stayed at a Stoke Depot for 6 days, Nike on-line assistant told me to collect from Argos pick up on the 20th December, nothing there, on the 21st December, lied and said they had spoken to DPD on a number I know does not give you access to speak to a human.    To make it more frustrating my wife order a pair of Nike`s for my son from Footlocker, cheap delivery 3 - 6 days, 2 days after me, they arrived today via DPD, you couldn't make it up!!!
C01155831531,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,C01155831531You should let customers know BEFORE they place a holiday order, that your holiday season is more than you all can handle. My order was partially received today, and the other child's order is still in Indiana and won't get here before Christmas. This has literally ruined their gift aspect of Christmas, and there's nothing I can do now. You've completely lost a customer to another shoe company with better reviews. I'd give negative stars If I could. This will teach me to read reviews before placing an order. Your reviews are horrible and absolutely reflect your service.
worse online experience i have ever…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,worse online experience i have ever had. ordered over 2 weeks without receiving anything, I called and follow up, been told it's under custom, i checked online myself, it's custom clear over 3 days already. customer services told me they will escalate it for me and will give me and update within 7-10 business days! that's such a bad experience. Adidas online is way way way better, i received my goods within 2 days without any issues.i will tell all my friends not to buy Nike, such a bad company ethics
Let down completely.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Purchased Nike golf shoes for my husband. Cost over £100 so not a cheap order. Due to ordering wrong size arranged to exchange and returned the first pair. 2 weeks later was still waiting then yesterday 13.12.2022 just an email to say Nike had cancelled my order. Absolute disgrace. Phoned up and they blamed a glitch on the system?!?! As an apology have given me a 20% off discount…. ??? So I have to spend money to use this apology!!! No idea if will come in time for Christmas. Not happy and not acceptable resolution.
If I could customer service a 0 I…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could customer service a 0 I would. Bought shoes for my husband for Christmas. Got an email that my order was not coming and was being sent back to their warehouse.  I ordered second pair so it would come before Christmas. Well I get the first order and can’t cancel the second because it was more than 30 minutes after the order was placed. I try to call to get Nike to pay for the return because I would never have bought two if it was not for them. The rep said sorry that I didn’t have their membership or could take it to a store which I don’t have the time for that.  What a joke
So poor from Jona,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,So poor from Jona. Takes 2 months to email me back and didn’t help at all with my complaint. To put it into context, my shoes which cost quite a bit - detached mid-run after just a couple of weeks! I thought it’ll be an easy exchange or return but no! Please contact me ASAP.
If I could rate 0 I would,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could rate 0 I would Do not even know where to begin with this lot , from a failed exchange to a return now holding my money so they can do some kind of investigation for a parcel that was returned two weeks ago and marked as delivered with royal mail. You try and speak to the robotic customer service agents and they offer 0 support or ability to take the queries to managers or higher.
Ordered some trainers - Delayed with Evri and resent via DPD - Good save Nike!,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Ordered some trainers - dispatched via Evri - parcel was stuck in normal rubbish evri mode - delayed! No update for over 10 days - contacted Nike and asked them to resend my trainers using a different courier. Received trainers via DPD 2 days later. Thank You - please stop using EVRI or offer customers option to pay an additional cost for DPD or UPS?! Save your company a lot of headache too!

Got told to send back and they would send the right ones out, 3 weeks later no trainers!!!

Read the bad reviews !!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Read the bad reviews , just because they are nike don't mean they handle situations responsibly. Ordered £145 trainers , said it was delayed 7 days after ordered , then to be told 10 days for refund , 15 days later still waiting from start of order till today I've waited 22 days. Ordered clothes , sent back tracked order via royal mail they recieved the items back 2 weeks ago , so 14 days later and yet again still no refunds for either order. I'll never use Nike online again customer service is disgusting.
No customer service here in the UK,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,No customer service here in the UK. I will avoid from now on. Simple stuck parcel, 12 days after delivery due and no complaint process. Customer service seems to have no care or duty and it is like knocking your head against a brick wall. I would avoid ordering from their site directly. Also no complaints process listed on their site at all? Shows their lack of care or commitment to customer satisfaction.
Don't bother!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Don't bother. Bought two pairs of trainers online and still waiting on delivery 1 month after purchase. No update on website and customer service is a joke.Update... Order lost in warehouse after service desk lying saying they are on route. Bought new pairs as they couldn't issue a refund straight away and payment was sent back to me for no reason.
Awful company,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This company has said the item that I have ordered is out of stock three times now and once last year.Why advertise a product if it is not in stock?Awful company.Ruined my sons birthday AND CHRISTMAS!!
Great products,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Great products, terrible website. If you are going to buy a pair of Nike's, do yourself a favor and find a retailer. The official website is complete trash but their shoes are great.
Bought air max tw size 8.5 on 12/14/22…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bought air max tw size 8.5 on 12/14/22 and they arrived in 4 days smelling like cat urine, I sent them back for an exchange. Nike received the return on 12/24/22 , it is now 1/2/23 and The status of the shoes is stuck at “preparing shipment” I called and what the nike athlete/associate told me was there was no update on my order and that they would “escalate” my order and my worst fears came to fruition after seeing other reviews with similar problems . The most ridiculous part is Nike usually waits until the item is out of stock and just refund you the money but the shoes I wanted had an abundance in stock and STILL couldn’t get them to me. I requested a refund and now im waiting for an “email” to the refund like I’ve been waiting for the “email “ for the shipment of my shoes. What a joke!!
I have ordered many times and they have…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have ordered many times and they have got worse and worse. Delivery takes ages and never turns up have to cancel and re order. Just done it to ma again. Not going to order from Nike again. Absolutely useless. For such a big company it’s a disgrace
How has nike become so poor,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,How has nike become so poor. Ordered trainers and a hoodie that i've been waiting for for over a week now. Keep getting messages saying theres been an issue but the parcel will be delivered tomorrow, tomorrow comes and no parcel, 6 TIMES!!! Customer service are terrible, just leave you on hold because they cant be bothered doing their job and half of them cant speak English, wheres the sense in that nike?! Joke of a business now, ill never order from them again!
The soles of the shoes rot away while…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The soles of the shoes rot away while you look at them. The shoe is still in perfect condition but the rubber used for the soles is crumbling like a dry cookie. For a company involved in childlabour and low wage exploitation i expect they have enough to spare for a good sole on the overpriced products they sell in the West.
Excellent customer service,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I ordered an item in oct as a xmas present. Realised when going to wrap early Dec, item was the wrong size. I was outside of the 60 day period that entited me to a refund. Rang customer services and was asked to take a photo of the item and send it in. Based on that I was issued a ful refund. Outstanding cutomer service
Awful company, avoid at all costs!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered a pair of trainers at the end of November, and now they have sent me two emails saying there was a system error and I owe them money?When calling them, they say they have refunded me, and completely ignoring the fact they have sent me two emails requesting I pay them! Spoken to three different people now, and one said I need to contact my bank!, even though it was their issue/ fault, and another said I don’t owe any money, and to ignore it, to which I have screenshots, and will be contacting trading standards about this! Another said, they are sorry for the emails, and to ignore them also! Do they even listen to what you are saying?What is the point of having live chat, or customer services when you don’t even listen to the customer! Appalling Company!!Update…. Still waiting for a refund two weeks later!!
My shoes came in broken,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My shoes came in broken. Damaged on the back. And not one, no both, the seller has seen it 100%, still sold them to me, something you would not aspect from nike. Ordered them new from the nike.com store. Would think you get the best and finest shoes 160 worth. After being in costumers support with ruth he told me or retour it, or take 15% discount. Not even a option to send me back new ones or give a 30% discount. Sadly I had to agree with this discount. 19 days later and still no discount on my bank. Costumers service this time had me talk with someone called princess, what a joke, I mean are they taking anything serieus there? After a rumble of text with her about information to verify me with her bad care and support she gave me no reason why it's still not on my bank. I could not fill in a complain by her, only give feedback that they throw away anyway. I will never ever ever order on nike ever again. Beautifull shoes, totaly ruined. This is one of the biggest companies in the wold and act like one of the lowest. Always had good feeling with nike. But that's totaly gone now.
Fast shipping and shoes are the right…,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Fast shipping and shoes are the right size BUT when the package came in the shoes were all over the place in the big box not the shoe boxes. Should have packed in a smaller box and put paper or something so the shoes didnt come out the shoe boxed when tossed around from ups. These were gifts so kinds embarrassing that they will open the shoe box to a brand new pair of AF1 to see the shoe box paper not looking fresh and neat. Hence the 4star review but other than that it was extremely fast shipping which I’m happy about. Font order from Hibbetts they take for ever and still don’t have a package i ordered on the days as i did with nike.
With holding refund tho proof of return sent,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Order returned via the correct channels via Royal Mail, sent proof of return clearly showing Royal Mail have the parcel, the rudest advisor ever said that as they have not received the parcel it is my problem. I was aghast, so rude and unhelpful, they owe me money and they say it’s in there terms and conditions, and I can’t find it anywhere and the advisor was going to send me the link and cut me off, so started a chat with another unhelpful person and demanded a call back from a manager. Unless you know 100% your keeping your purchase then buy elsewhere.
I ordered a pair of "Nike by you"…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered a pair of "Nike by you" trainers and the quality is awful. If you want a pair of nikes I would suggest you buy fakes as youll get a better pair of shoes, the quality control seems to be non-existent at the genuine factory.
Ordered with 25% discount now Nike have…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered with 25% discount now Nike have pulled the full amount from my account. I called Nike and they promised to have get someone who could help to call me back, no one called. Now I will have to use time on sending the products back. No good impact on environment
Following-up on a previous review…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Following-up on a previous review I made. I ordered goods on October 30th from Nike.ca. I received somebody else's order by accident and did not receive ANY of the items I had paid for. Immediately initiated a return process and shipped back the erroneous goods. It has now been over a full month with no advance in my file. Every time I contact Nike.ca support I get a new story about what is going on. Horrible experience and they have held my money hostage for 30+ calendar days. Totally unacceptable. I will now be contesting the charge directly with my credit card provider and bank. Do NOT buy anything online from Nike.ca. This should have been a simple refund but has turned into a nightmare.
Bought the same pair of running shoes…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bought the same pair of running shoes in size 5 and 5.5 and the  difference in the quality between the two of them is unbelievable. One of them had support, the other was flat inside. I wrote a review on their website saying this - however it never got published!
If I could give a zero score I would,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could give a zero score I would. Placed an order first week of December. They took my payment and then 5 days later I received an email to say delivery would be delayed. Went on live chat today to chase only to be told they currently have no stock and the trainers won't arrive in time for Christmas. They told me there was a pair at a London store but I would have to go there in person, they were not able to arrange delivery. Tried to escalate a complaint only to be told they do not respond to complaints, they just use them as feedback to improve their service?!!!!!! So disappointed!!! Total let down before Christmas. If I had known they had stock issues I would have bought elsewhere, now it's too late.
Disgraceful customer services,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Disgraceful customer services. They've owed me a refund for 4 weeks and every time I speak to them they say they're sorting them today but nothing. Never buy from them
Worst company in the world to deal with…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst company in the world to deal with regarding complaints in the uk. Tryed for about 10 hours to get hold of someone. Eventually returned trainers to the shop and managed to get a refund. This is a totally rip off company
If I could have rated 0 I definitely…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I could have rated 0 I definitely would of. Absolutely will NEVER order again from here. Completely messed up my order for a Christmas present. Got a coat on Black Friday deal, when it came to delivery it never got attempted and was sent back to nike. I asked nike if they could redirect it and told me loads of different reasons on why they couldn’t, one example was that my parcel was lost and then on another example they couldn’t send it back because of there ‘system’. For such a big company you think they could work round there system or simply just change it. So much hassle, customer service is absolutely terrible! Appalling!!!!!
What went wrong? What didn't go wrong.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,What went wrong? Let's try to figure out what hasn't gone wrong. I expected a lot more out of this company. My recent order is over 10 days late. (C01151975924) An investigation has been opened and yet I'm still waiting on the outcome of that and it's been two days. Upon realising my parcel was late I spoke to 4 different people to try and sort this out as I needed it in time for a birthday. Yet nothing has been done and I'm still in the same situation. I have been told to wait rather then given any actual solutions. I understand the world is hard at the moment and deliveries take longer over Christmas but I orders it over 2 weeks ago, and it was marked in transit two days after ordering. So it was obvious there was an issue early on but nothing was done.
Snkrs app is for bot users,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Snkrs app is for bot users. Would suggest getting into botting to be able to secure them pairs that are dropping. Dont believe me then have a conversation with nike on chat/call. You will realise they favour bots
Returned/Exchanged shoes,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Returned shoes. Posted on 1st. My order which would be the correct size was cancelled on the 7th. Contacted them and told there was nothing they could do, if I wanted the new size I'd need to buy them again. They can check the label they sent me to see if it is active, but they don't. I can provide them with a tracking code for proof that thhey are in transit, but I still need to buy the other size again? Net profits of $21.5bn and I need to buy the shoes again because their system doeesn't function properly? They cannot tell me why the order was cancelled and wont place me a new order. Will take my business elsewhere, what a joke.
After reading these reviews,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,After reading these reviews, I feel a little bit better about being so bitter about nike. I placed an order for a pair of shoes (12/10) for my boyfriend for his birthday (12/21). They confirmed my order and started "preparing shipment". It went on that way for 8 days when the previously expected delivery date would be 12/19. I contacted customer service several times on their chat only to be answered with the same generic answer every time, but they still said my order would arrive by 12/19. On the morning of 12/19 I got an email saying my shipment was delayed. Guess he won't be getting those for his birthday, he'll be lucky to get them before  his next birthday at this point. Just all around nike is a terrible company to deal with and I will not be ordering again.
Terrible, worst experience ever,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible, stay away. I have not received the shoes for two months, and the company refuses to provide a refund
unprofessional,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,unprofessional, they don't have a synchronized balance in the warehouse and the web, so they sell things and charge without having the possibility to deliver them
No Refund Despite Being Received,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 2 Liverpool tracksuits for our grandchildren and both arrived on schedule, however the colours of the Strike kit do not seem representative of the Liverpool kit, so decided to return it. Sent the item (£89.95) back via Royal Mail 48 Hour tracking which was confirmed as being received by Nikeon 14/12/22, but to date no refund received. Rang the customer service line on 20/12/22 who confirmed they’d received the item but wouldn’t issue a refund until they’d Investigated’ the return. Operator refused to put me through to a supervisor and requested I sent a photo of the RM tracking receipt, which I did. To date no refund received so have created a Resolution centre issue on PayPal. The Nike customer service is a complete joke and I would recommend to anyone thinking of using this company. BEWARE
what a joke,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,what a joke - tracking says its waiting delivery, but Nike have not dispatched the item.Callcenter and online help is a joke - they have a set script that the regurgitate but no actual Manager or any help is provided

Go somewhere else to buy Nike if you are a Nike person,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I just want to say that dealing with Nike has become complete bullsh*t. My order has now taken almost 5 day to even send out and still hasn’t been sent . I understand that maybe this shoe needs to be sent in from somewhere else ? Maybe it’s not readily available at a warehouse? Or maybe you guys are backed up ? In my opinion there is no excuse at all. U have the shoe on your website as if it is available. I payed for the shoe as if it was available without the knowledge that it would take forever to even ship. The website is dogsh*t Most of the time I dread ordering from Nike.com cause I know it will take forever so most of the time it’s a last resort. And On top of that your inventory on your website is complete trash.The fact that you can’t go to the actual source , the actual brand Nike , to get there premium selections without being mislead and clicking in the item only to realize that it’s not even in stock is rediculous.  And you have shoes still up as if there in stock and u click on the shoe and then it tells you not available. All Nikes shoe selections have been so bad lately as well. I hope someone Important can see this because I’m actually a huge Nike fan and supporter and at this point I’m frustrated enough to write this to let u guys know that I’m about done with the half a** service and selections. Nike as a company is supposed to be top of the line and clearly the major corporation greed is overriding what I though Nike was supposed to be.
Purchase two pairs of shoes 5 months…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Purchase two pairs of shoes 5 months ago, took 1 month to arrive in Customs Auckland - since then there were no more updates. After requesting an investigation that took a further month I requested a refund.It has now been 5 months, many phone calls, no shoes, and NO REFUND, I am beyond frustrated. I’ve been advised that Nike has refunded me to a PayPal account in CAD dollars. Firstly I paid with my NZ credit card in NZD. I do not have a PayPal account and I have not received any refund in any of my accounts.We are now disputing this refunded - all over two pairs of shoes purchased 5 months ago costing me $238.94 NZD ouch! Do I cut my losses or keep fighting? Do not buy from this company
Useless. Ripped trainers received no way to return...,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Useless. NEVER use them just buy from a reseller. I received RIPPED trainers, which I sent pictures of. Their FAQs stated they have a choice of printable returns slips or QR codes with no printer needed.This is a lie. They will simply send you a standard returns label which needs a printer and make up so random lie as to what part is the QR code. When you go online or to the post office you can CLEARLY SEE this is NOT a QR code yet their monkeys with keyboards at Nike will keep repeating that it is a QR code no matter what evidence you provide them to the contrary.I am lucky I paid these thieves through PayPal so I will get PayPal to refund me and throw the ripped junk "Nike" sent me in the bin...
Nike The Narcissist,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I’m so dissatisfied with Nike the company as a whole is horrible I know it’s not the employees fault or the customer service representatives but every time I make a purchase if I have to do it in exchange for whatever reason usually sizing or quality they seem to never get my order right or actually send me my return they just give you your money back and then tell you that they’re out of stock they never know when they’re going to be in stock so you can’t ever get what you want and then whenever you call and speak about it they have no recollection of verification you ever called it’s like it’s nonexistent I just feel like I was working with a narcissist like they gaslighted me the whole entire time every time

I’m extremely Disappointed with the Customer Service …,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I’m extremely Disappointed with the service I have received from Nike since the 21st Nov, I have been waiting on a refund for £123 and been told on multiple occasions it’s on its way, I’ve had to call over 6 times and every time being told it was never arriving, then they speak to a manager advise it’s sorted and I’m still to receive it or answers of when. When asked to speak to a manager I’m being told they don’t have a complaints department, I’ll just have to wait, I have no faith or trust this refund is arriving, I’m waiting to purchase a tracksuit for my son for Christmas which will never arrive in time, I’m offering solutions and having no support at all with this. So anyone wishes to purchase anything from Nike, I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone at this moment in time, such poor customer services

Awful customer service.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful customer service.I ordered a pair of fairly expensive fly knit trainers which were due for delivery over a week ago.Received an email advising of dispatch, and upon continually checking the couriers app (DPD) it was apparent that parcel hadn’t left warehouse and courier was ‘expecting it’.I made 5 calls to various ‘customer service agents’ and advised them that parcel was not in the delivery system and hadn’t even left the warehouse, but was continually fobbed of, and advised it was ‘ in the system’.Eventually managed to contact DPD,  who confirmed that the parcel had never been received by them.I was eventually able to speak to a Nike agent today, who confirmed that parcel had not left warehouse.A replacement had been issued, and they couldn’t even offer a next day delivery .This was meant to be a Christmas present that will now not arrive in time.Really bad service.

Shocking service and theft of gift card cash,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Shocking service! I placed an order on 30/11 to be shipped by 08/12. I checked my order progress on 14/12 and it was still in progress. I used the chat service to chase to then be told my order was cancelled on 01/12 for which i received no notification. I paid using a mix of gift card and credit card. the 1st advisor informed be it was bank issue and to contact my bank. The next advisor said it was an issue with my gift cards. They have no clue! I've now reordered using the same payment methods. The options i have is to escalate a complaint which could take 7 days or let the advisor monitor the order for 48 hours to see if it processes. If it doesn't progress, it will get escalated and guess what, it'll be upto 9 days then. Nike are happy to cash gift cards without notifying customers that orders have been cancelled. It feels like theft to me! Beware when dealing with this global brand!
This Bias Incident at Nike Company Store,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,This evening, my family and I visited the Nike Employee Store and I experienced poor treatment due to my disability. On crutches and wearing a boot on my right foot, I was told I would not be able to sit down inside the store because I would get "in the way". After searching for several minutes, an employee found a chair and told me I could sit in a hallway used as a fire exit. But, since I'd be blocking the exit, I'd have to leave if requested. Due to this unacceptable treatment, my family and I chose to leave the store. I've been unable to contact management, the store's phone will not pick up or accept messages. I chatted with a representative at Nike.com and they could not provide me any contact information for store management.I believe it's important for disabled members of our society to know that Nike had embraced ableist policies and is not willing to make accommodations at their employee store.

Bad Business,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,As we all know when Jordan’s come out it’s first come first serve right. Well I was able to get my son a pair of Jordan’s on Dec. 10th 2022 at 10am when they dropped. Received notice I got them so I paid like I normally do. Money taken right away as usual. It is Dec 21 an no shoes still. I’ve been looking at tracking info since the next day after purchasing. “Waiting for Carrier “ is what it says. So I contact nike via chat. I was told the shoes are stuck an not sure where they’re at. An offered a refund that will take 5-8 business days. It’s 4 days away from Christmas an this is what I’m being told! Really nike? That’s it? If the shoes were for me I would be fine but there for my son. The only thing he asked for. Only thing. All I get told is I’m sorry would you like to start the refund process. Like wow. As many items myself my son my family have purchased from this company an that’s how I’m treated after their mistake. Myself and anyone that I know who orders from here won’t be purchasing anything else!
NIKE.COM is a Total Christmas FAIL - AGAIN!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,For the 3rd year in a row, I have ordered from Nike.com against my better judgment and once again, they failed me. How stupid am I? Still waiting on Christmas gifts that were ordered December 15, long before their Christmas delivery cut-off date - PLUS Paid $20 to expedite shipping..yet still haven't received any of it 2 weeks later. I have called customer service and that was no help. They blamed it on the snowstorm, and yet every other company I ordered from got my stuff here on time. Plus, FedEx still says they have never received the package from Nike. (You can't blame a snowstorm when the package was never actually shipped, Nike.) I will NOT order from them again and will try to cancel this order. As I said, this has happened to me for 3 Christmases in a row: 2020, 2021 and 2022 despite the fact that they guarantee Christmas delivery each time. I'm convinced they are selling items that don't yet exist and then scrambling to catch up. PLUS I just read that they continue to have a poor track record for human rights abuses in their factories. Yet another very good reason to avoid this company in the future.
Nike's online fulfilment is clearly not fit for purpose.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike has fallen a very long way indeed. From global sporting brand super power to literally one of the worst brands/retailers. The UK warehouse clearly cannot cope with the orders it is receiving. Placed a first order for 2 pairs of leggings waited 5 days..no dispatch email, no tracking... Live chat reported that the order had been 'lost'... Immediately 'dispatched' a second order...Guess what? 11 days later.. No sign of the order, back to live chat, turns out that the order hadn't been shipped at all... Asking for a full refund to be told that "Normally I have to make you wait 10 days after the estimated delivery due date which is December 12th..."  which was 4 DAYS AGO.....  SO can't give a refund because i should wait another 6 days...I ask for a tracking number... ah yes.. It hasn't actually been shipped!!  SO in essence me, the customer, has to wait, in total 17 days before i can get a refund for an order that Nike never shipped in the first place?!!  Wow... AVOID AT ALL COSTS

A hassle to get refunded,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,In summary, Nike is very quick to take your money and extremely slow to give it back if there are any issues with your order. And please be especially careful when placing orders online. While placing my last order, Nike used an automated address and I realized it was an incomplete/wrong address only after placing the order. I tried to change the address before any packages were shipped by contacting customer service, which is itself a black hole. They said their system won't allow any modifications. I then tried contacting UPS and FedEx to change the address after the the multiple packages were shipped but UPS said shipper (Nike) does not allow it. That said, I was able to change the FedEx package; however, after more than a week of the package heading my way, I got an email that all of my packages, including via FedEx, were being rerouted back to Nike. I've been back and forth with customer service for days now trying to get my money back for all of the items and they have been dodgy at best. I've had other shipping and customer service issues lately with Nike including missing items from orders, and have since come to the conclusion that it's far too much hassle now to order from Nike and the quality just isn't worth the trouble. I'd recommend shopping elsewhere.
I wish I could leave a zero star…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I wish I could leave a zero star rating.Ordered a gift card and a personalised message card for a Christmas giftOrder arrived and I noticed a mistake made by Nike called to ask if a new personalised message card could be sent out, I was told NO instead I should cancel the gift card and place a new one. I did this because I was told it would arrive before Christmas.After waiting and contacting customer services team several times to find out that the 2nd gift card hadn't even been shipped. I requested a full refund on both orders. I spoke to several people from customer services who were extremely helpful, I was informed on 30/12/2022 that my 2nd gift card had been dispatched (dispite my request to cancel it) it arrived on 03/01/2023 via UPS I refused to accept it and told the courier to return it to Nike. I sent a email to Nike informing them about the despicable level of service I had received and that I would be leaving a negative review, it was only then did I receive a response and a apology (with a 15% discount on my next order) as if I would ever purchase from them again.I have been told on 05/01/2023 that my refunds have been issued but will take between 5-9 days to arrive in my account. I wish I had read the reviews on this site before ordering from Nike

Amazing experience from Nike,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazing experience from Nike! A website discount code would not work, so I sent Nike a tweet. They said if I put the order through on the website and send them the order number they would apply it to my order, and only deduct the discounted total from my bank. Having read all these negative trustpilot reviews I was rather dubious, but as the order was a birthday present, I went ahead and ordered. My bank account showed a pending amount without the discount, but when the amount was eventually taken from my bank, it was for the discounted total. So the discount was honoured. Delivery was also earlier then expected, so the trainers arrived well before the birthday!! I ordered on 23rd November, the birthday was on the 1st of December, trainers arrived on the 26th November! It would seem those who have a positive experience with Nike are not leaving reviews, hence all the negative reviews. So I have decided to leave an honest review to reassure buyers, it is not all bad. Nike Twitter team were true to their word, and my trainers that were a gift arrived in plenty of time.
A gesture as useful as a chocolate teapot!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have to say that I am totally disappointed for such a large reputable company to have such a poor customer service system, I ordered products in the black Friday sales total should have been £301 but with the discounts it came to £179,this parcel went missing and being Christmas presents for my niece and daughter I was keen to re-order the items, Unfortunately the only thing Nike could offer was to refund me ( this would take up to 9 days to reach my account), I could then replace my order with a 20% discount code and hope everything turned up on time. the issue with this gesture for me is that, I don't have £240 (£60 more than my original order) spare this time of year to place the order that has been lost and also its not actually a good will gesture when I have to spend more money before my refund arrives and also risk not getting presents on time anyway. this to me was about as much use as a chocolate teapot! all i wanted was for them to process the order again from their end with the correct discount applied and free next day shipping, which should be easy for a company of their size and status........

Would be 0,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Would be 0. Atrocious customer service. I ordered trainers for my son with a delivery date of 12th December. Did not arrive. Rang Nike call centre in Egypt (there is no British based help line) There were language barriers. I was told the trainers would be with me within 24hours. Still not received 21 December so rang again. Someone answered but did not speak to me so rang again. The second person said that they were lost and they would give me a refund. I said I did not want a refund as they are a christmas present. She told me she would send another pair and asked me the size. She came back to me to say that there were no 8's so she would give me a refund and I could get another pair and gave me a 20 per cent off. I asked if I could spend this at a shop to which she replied no. I said I cannot order on line as she had told me there were no 8s. She said that I could.  When i finished the call i went on line to see if the trainers were in stock in his size and they were not available.This went on for  some time. I asked for a manager to ring me back and this has not happened. My son does not now have his christmas present. Terrible customer service nd i was repeatedly lied to and will never use Nike again.
Bad experience online and return…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bad experience online and return policy! Never again.
My order never arrived and hasn’t been refunded 6weeks later,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My order never arrived, I chased it up and eventually found out it had been lost in transit. Nike said they would cancel the order (which I would presume also means processing a refund for it) and I would need to place the order again. They gave me a discount code for the inconvenience which I was going to use, and at that point I would’ve been a happy customer. However, since then Nike haven’t let Klarna know that they cancelled my order so now Klarna think I owe them £400. The order was placed on 29th Oct. We’re in mid December now. I’ve contacted Klarna, they tell me to speak to Nike. Nike have been ignoring my emails dated 15 Nov and 04 Dec. I’ve rang the Nike customer service line twice and both times I have been unable to hear what the service agent is saying, either because of the fuzzy line, the level of English language or a combination of the two. I’m sorry to bring this up but it’s a problem as it’s caused even more frustration at this situation and it’s the only mode of communication you offer on your website. I can’t believe how appalling the communication has been. As a principle I won’t be buying Nike products anymore.

Courier then emailed me 5 days later saying that my parcel is not suitable for DPD pickup point collection. I then called nike customer service and they told me i would be given a refund. I explained i do not want a refund but i want the trainers, the gentleman on the phone said this is not possible (although the trainers are available). I asked if i could log a complaint he told me only thing i can do is fill up a feedback form on their website. I asked for an email to make a formal complaint and he said they do not have one. I then asked to speak to a senior manager and he told me that the manager has refused to speak to me….  You took 204£ out of my account 5 days ago… and now no trainers and i have to wait another 10 days or so for a refund. Order number: C01161950202I even asked if they can arrange for me to go and pick them up at a Nike store and he told me this is not possible. Person i spoke to goes my the name of Jan and he gave me this reference number for the call: 75597186. Extremely disappointed as i needed these trainers for a birthday present. If the trainers were not available i would understand the error but they are! Also now i dont have enough money to go buy a replacement for birthday present as the refund has not been processed yet. Rating 0.  Very disappointed and frankly very angry! :(
NIKE ARE THIVES, STEALING MONEY FROM CUSTOMERS !,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,These guys are an absolute disgrace to the company. I’ve been a valuable member to this company for 26 years ! I’ve spent 10 thousand pounds in just 2 years ! So when the snobby robotic customer service refuse to give my money back when I showed multiple proofs that I sent the item with the return label they gave me I have become stressed, angry and hurt that the company I once loved betrayed me. You were better of calling me a liar and a thief. There is no other reason, logically thinking when someone has spend so much money with you why on earth would he lie about a returned item. Nike are saying they can’t find them item and because there policy they can’t refund me, how disgraceful. I wish I could put the pics of my evidence and the chats and the slow and horrible emails I have received from this company. They don’t care !They stole my money, they gave me a return label that was apparently used already and when I tell them this label was generated by you guys it’s not my fault they again don’t give one. I can’t say how frustrated I am still, I am trying to still get my money back and I won’t give up !Nike you guys are a disgrace for this, a multi billionaire company mugging me off for £144 pounds no way I will quit when I know I am innocent !Nike are the thieves.Started 15/11/2022 - Case still ongoing. FYI - Multiple SLA breaches the reason I am putting my foot down because for two months I have been told to wait. I have to reply to my own emails and messages because no reply after 4-5 days even longer when they promised they’d call ! No call ! When they promise a response ! No response, I only get a response when I message them I want expose these guys because this service is a disgrace to great people that built Nike hiring these LAZY WORKERS WHO DON’T CARE !
DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! AVOID,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely shocking online customer service. Have been waiting for over 2 weeks for a refund on a product i never received due to the item not being in stock requested a refund on the 29th November and was told I’d receive a confirmation email for the refund within 24 hours never did… went back on live chat was asked the same questions again and was told they would process the refund even though I already thought it had been done… was told to wait another 5-9 working days to receive this still never did. Went back on the live chat  and was assured that I would receive the refund by today (2 weeks later) STILL NOTHING. have gone back onto the chat to speak to someone today and was told again that they would process the refund absolutely shocking customer service after trying to explain my frustration to this person on the live chat they just ended it… shocking when your job is meant is focused on ‘customer experience’ Called up and spoke to a nice representative called Kalin who sincerely apologised for this and could see that none of the times I requested a refund was it actually processed. He assured me I would receive the refund confirmation by tomorrow and the actual refund within another 5-9 working days… I would NEVER purchase from the Nike store again.
For such as a big company, customer service and returns is awful.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike is a huge company making so much money but when it comes to getting a refund. They are a nightmare. Tracking clear shows they have received it but their customer service tells you to wait up to 2 weeks before they can even initiate refund process. None of the other companies take this long. Some companies even initiate the refund on the spot as a goodwill gesture. Definitely not buying from Nike again and going to other companies that never have this problem.Update two (15/12/22):They told me to wait till today to reach out. After telling them the tracking numbers that are generated on the order page. They still required photos of the post office receipts. Surely they can just input the tracking numbers onto Royal Mail webpage to check?After contacting them again with the photos, they have now sent the photos of the same tracking numbers to a senior team for processing. They asked for another 3-5 working days which means at this rate, it takes at least 1 whole month since sending it back to receive refund. This is assuming there's no issues. Nike has the worst customer service I have experienced out of all the many places I have shopped. I would definitely recommend Adidas or Reebok in the future, they make great shoes and customer service is so much better.

Jorden 6 rings toddler horrible condition zero rating if it was possible,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If I was able to give the rating a zero I would with no problem. I have ordered a pair of Jorden Rings 6 Atmosphere/ Black/White/Infrared 23 toddler for my niece size 6 C the condition of the shoes I have to say they were in horrible condition the white part of the shoes had black marks on one shoes than the other shoes was even finish I was able to see dry glue at the corners of the head of the shoes. I’m very disappointed in the condition my shoes came in. I even spoke to customer services and blame the shipping process which made no sense because my box was even destroyed its very unacceptable and inconvenient that I have to return these shoes due to inaccurate inspection on Nike end which this wasn’t done correctly seem like they don’t really care about there products at all if they able to send out shoes unfinished but marks on the shoes . I’ll be returning these and going else where I recommend kids foot locker. I wouldn’t recommend shopping online with Nike thats if you want incomplete product either do a pick order so your able to return that item. I hope no customer has to experience the condition my shoes were in. It just shows that it doesn’t matter to them if they lose out on one customer sense they profit no matter what so differences it makes. Nike has really given up on the quality care and attention to details on their product.

Website function is terrible,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Took a couple days to get one of the two digital gift cards that I ordered that was supposedly going to be emailed to me in "approximately 2 hours or less". After I ordered the digital gift card and hadn't received anything for a while, I was told by a representative that for some reason Nike had canceled the transaction (much to my surprise since I received no email from them indicating that it had been canceled). I also still haven't received the second gift card. It really doesn't make sense to me that as big of a company as Nike is, they can't send digital gift cards automatically after purchase and that their website functions very poorly. The only reason why I paid for digital Nike gift cards in the first place was that I tried ordering shoes with visa gift cards and the website wouldn't accept more than one visa gift card as payment for the transaction. I know better next time to just go to a retailer.*Update: I ended up talking with another chat agent earlier today about still having not received the second digital card I ordered. Through a quick process, the agent sent me another gift card, and oddly started flirting with me afterward (just seemed a little unprofessional and off the wall). Later on, I tried ordering shoes online with the gift cards and kept receiving an error message. I ended up talking to another agent on the phone who, after trying it from their end and talking with a supervisor, was unable to figure out why the transaction wasn't going through. I'm not blaming the agent as she was saying that Nike wasn't giving a detailed description of why the transaction wasn't going through. However, it does go to show how seemingly outdated and dysfunctional the Nike website/order processing system is, which really doesn't make sense with how big a corporation it is.

At first I requested the return because Nike does not make 2 exchanges. so i went to the nike store on oxford street and asked them to change it and they told me they would change it but they gave me the size 4.5 uk.I only realized when I got home. It was very big than Before I sent the sneakers back, I got in touch with nike's chat and the attendant gave me a new return label. now i contact nike and they say they already refund me in november if i'm not mistaken. I asked a recept for the refund and I sad: I have all my bank statements and that there are no refunds from Nike even because the sneakers were exchanged for the right color but the wrong size. My shoes arrived 05/01 with 2 more returns. they have a sneaker left in stock and they don't refund me. They now it’s mine but teu are making my refund difficult  Is it simply a commodity left over from Nike's stock? I want my money back or send me the shoe back and I'll try to exchange it for a smaller size or I'll wear it that big anyway. i want a solution. this is disrespectful to the customer. I get in touch every day and every day the deadlines are different. I just want my money back and that's it. if the chat attendant made an error when sending a return label or if nike from oxford street did not indicate that an exchange instead the regund was made problem is not mine. Nike that resolves itself internally and stops leaving the customer waiting without any solution. what a neglect. I want my money back. This return turned a big headache forMe.

Awful,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful! Worst customer service experience ever. Shoes were apparently delivered to store. I had the email stating shoes will be there for 10 days. I go on fourth day, and really out of my way to get them too. Owner says shoes have been returned to Nike upon UPS request. Says UPS doesn't let the shops keep for more than two days (??). Says I have to call UPS. Gives me UPS number. My kid now doesn't have his trainers for his birthday the next day. Kid in tears. Spend ages on phone to UPS. They eventually tell me shop owner refused to even accept the delivery in the first place. Going round in circles and plenty confusion. I call Nike: 1. Why wasn't I notified that shoes aren't there? 2. Why aren't they there? 3. Kid's birthday ruined 4. I have to now spend more the next day trying to make it up to him 5. Have now spent hours of time I don't have driving around and calling trying to resolve. Nike rep says he'll get everything sorted out and agrees I should be compensated. So maybe I will return to Nike after this. 5 days go by....no word, no email, no call...I email. No reply. I email again...and again....and again..... Finally today call again, have to go through the whole thing yet again. Very sweet rep can't apologise enough, refunds immediately and compensates 20% off next purchase. Obviously there's nothing she can personally do about that, but the compensation is offensive and I will definitely not ever be buying for me or my family ever again. Order no.C01129931140

Utterly appalling customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Utterly appalling customer service, having followed up on an email on  9th December 2022 stating that my order had been "cancelled or returned." This was a very much sought after Christmas present for my son. Nike Customer Services could not offer a reasonable explanation as to why it had cancelled,  despite that I had email confirmation with a tracking number and inform of dispatch. I was then advised later that day of the following - "Hello! I think we got disconnected. I discussed the matter with my supervisor and it is possible that the automatic refund was triggered because the item was shortly unavailable for dispatch. However, this money will be back in your account within 9 working days. I am very sorry for this situation, it does not usually happen."The following day on 10th December 2022, I recieved a further email - "Thanks for your order. Your payment overview is attached.* (If we send more than one package, you might see more than one payment overview notice.) You can track your package here. We’ll get your shipment to you as soon as possible. In the meantime, feel free to contact us with any questions.Nike.com" Confusing to say the least, does this mean I can still expect the package? No......The link does not allow to 'track your package', only showed the order remains 'returned.' No idea if I am to actually expect the package now or whether I will recieve refund in a timely manner. I have lost confidence in Nike and will not be purchasing from them again. I would advise anyone considering purchase for Christmas, as it is doubtful you will recieve item or your money back in time to remedy their error. I would like to draw your attention to another review also dated 9th December 2022, which they appear to highlight a similar issue.⚠️71% ONE star reviews! (Shocker!) AVOID at all costs!⚠️

Don't buy big branded names that disregard that people and only focus on skinny people,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I've been buying Nike for all my life I put on a bit of weight but I'm not that big I'm certainly not obese my weight 11 and a half stones I can't fit in any of the tracksuit I think it's very unfair that nike make clothing for skinny people and not clothing to encourage fat people to go to the gym because we don't have anything to wear down at the gym we just look like wearing tight clothing it's just material Just add more material and make the jacket bigger make the trousers bigger what's wrong with you people that you don't want to see fat people have self-confidence you want us to stay at home saying we need to lose weight before we can go to the gym and look like other people or we have to stick up like a sore thumb coming into the gym with clothes that don't fit you take our money you don't care and then you just focus on making slim skinny people happy you don't actually encourage us to feel good about ourselves we have money we can buy clothes but you don't make the clothes for us you make the clothes for the skinny people shame on you and if I ever shift the weight I will certainly stop myself from ever going to night to shop again because I've seen that your fashion industry is not focused on the people that used to buy your stuff but when we put on a bit of weight  you totally disregarded us like we are nothing if that people could cover up the fat instead of having it bulging out from tight clothing we would be more than happy to spend all day in the gym no nobody is actually looking at our body instead we stay at home depressed because there's nothing to make us look good when we go down the gym while other people are fitting in their Close perfectly we are made to look like some kind of joke because you put extra large in the clothing and it's not for large people it's for slim people with an extra large tag when are you going to do the sports industry a favour and think about what it's like to be fat and want to go down the gym if we just had clothing that would cover up our shame we could work out until we shrink and become what we want to be but if the clothes don't fit and and how would you expect us to go down to the gym booking like mutton dressed as lamb or define some cheap stretchy trouser and a big baggy plain old t-shirt with no name no brand we want fashion we want like signs we want to look good just like other people when we go to the gym wearing fashionable names that we love instead we now take our money and buy a chocolate cake and wallow in misery at home because nobody wants our money when we say we want to buy ourselves a beautiful tracksuit and go down to the gym we have to go there with asking showing stretched out in something tight and everybody laughing up belly is popping out and things like that we just want to be covered up jackets that zip up properly we're good padding in certain places you can't even be bothered to design anything for the bigger person you go on like you are trying to design something for an elephant so you don't bothered to try well we are not elephants we are just humans and we are not over beast we're just a little bit bigger than what you say is extra large or extra extra large you do not cater for women of size you regard us like we are nothing not even worth looking into or we don't actually think of Fashion people should be able to dress in whatever they want but the fashion industry is racist bias non-inclusive rejected because people are a little bit overweight you expect us to Just Lose self-confidence and not want to be part of society I'm fed up of going into your sports shop seeing nice tracksuits made from stretchy material and you can't even add some more material and stitching you think that we want the clothes for free well we have money I'll let you know we can buy these clothes but you don't make them in our size if it's going to cost you more to make them in bigger sizes then put the price up we will pay for the items if they're costing you much more to make we will buy them but first stop your selfish way of thinking and design clothes for fat people we demand change
website drop and support,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,the worst website I ever met for dropsI lose 3 drops just because of sms code, that didnt come on the phone. Support didnt do anything..
poor customer service who couldn't understand English,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Missing item from my parcel, no delivery note inside to say that the missing item is coming in a different parcel.  Called Nike, first call got cut off after waiting 7 mins, 2nd call was answered but was having IT difficultly so couldn't access my order and asked me to call back.  3rd call, took another 7 mins to answer, the girl answering the phone had very poor English, couldn't understand me properly, the phone line was really bad, very noisy and cracking background and kept cutting out. I would expect better from such a international large brand like Nike.
Cancelled my order cause what I ordered was out of stock,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Bought a pair of shoes from Nike and after 5 days they emailed to say the shoes are out of stock. Don’t order on their website cause there is no point when they just cancel the order for you. Waste of time
Phantom delivery,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Tracking service says delivered but no delivery! Did a web chat and have to wait 8 working days for a response, this is useless as item was for a very much wanted Xmas present and I have been left with no alternative but to re-order at full price and deliver to a different address. Will be disputing the transaction with credit card company.Another customer lost.
Shocking customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Shocking customer service. My sons training are lost and as the customer I am stuck in the middle between Nike and DPD and neither will resolve the issue until the other has taken action. Basically neither will take responsibility for their actions!! Every time I speak to Nike I have to wait another 24hrs! Currently I have to wait another 24hrs for a manager who may or may not decide to call me back!!!! Best solution they can offer me currently is a refund for the shoes that were on offer and I have to re order the trainers at full price. Whilst waiting 5 days for the funds to be returned to me. Seriously lack of understanding that there is a cost of living crisis going on!! Meanwhile my son still has no trainers.
DO NOT BUY,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY. They are not legitimate and lie. You will not get your order. DO NOT USE nike.com
Missing item from Nike,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 3 items from Nike, 2 of 3 were delivered. When I asked where the missing item is, I was told their senior team would look into it. Response came back as case closed, no refund!! I've never once asked for a refund just the items I ordered. Refusing to answer any of my questions or explain what measures they've taken to try and track the missing item.Terrible customer service throughout.
An utterly, utterly useless 'store'.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,An utterly, utterly useless 'store'.Won't accept payment, with debit card, credit card, paypal, or anything else. Just hangs and gives you a 'sorry this is taking a while, don't refresh' type message... that hangs there for -- literally -- HOURS until you give up and refresh. And try again. And again. And again. Until the store eventually blocks you trying.You literally canot buy anything from this 'store'. I can only assume the entire thing is a fake. No actual products. Or they are sitting around on mountains of boxes wondering why no-one orders anything.I even called them and their -- useless, of course -- suggestion was to 'try paypal' (nope, doesn't work). Hopeless.An annoying, expensive (in terms of my time -- for which I am normally paid) waste of time. Avoid Nike or use their physical stores.[EDIT: Eventually, an HOUR after starting the payment process, I managed to get it to work on another browser. Still an epic technical mess by Nike and will forever avoid starting a purchase with them to avoid it. Sort it out NIke!]
Quality horrendous and customer support even worse,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike sent trainers out and the quality of the trainer was appalling only to get fobbed off by a customer support chat person  only for him to then end the chat on me as its his 5 o'clock clocking out time. Absolute disgusting

Don’t make customers pay for Nike’s errors,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Tried to order when Nike was offering 25% off everything. Over 4 days the order kept failing to go through. Was told by customer service that this was a Nike website issue which had been fixed after the 25% promo had finished. Told I could now order the items at full price with only a 10% discount as an apology - no offer to match the original discount. Not impressed that due to a Nike issue I could not order the items with a valid discount but instead told to pay a higher price. Am taking my business elsewhere.
I have been treated very bad from Nike,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I have been treated very bad from Nike. I made two orders that were shipped together, sadly both were stolen by the driver and never delivered to me. I only received refund for the small order of £30 not for the big £300+ one.Your live chat agent Joy gave me zero support, help or comprehension.He denied me to talk to a manager.He refused to give me any identification number to retrieve the chat.I am pretty sure I was lied to.My family is now suffering from this.My kids are left with no gift for their birthday.I’m left with no help from Nike and no refund.I have screenshot of the full chat conversations to prove what I’m saying.
AWFUL!!!!!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,AWFUL!!!!!!!! IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT YOU SHOES, ORDER FROM ANOTHER STORE. Order a pair of Jordan’s from the Nike store, they sat awaiting to be picked up by carried for a week and then I had to messaged them twice asking where they was for them to come back and tell me they have lost them, like they just vanished into thin air, then instantly said about a refund instead of sending a pair of shoes & offered me 10% discount when I had 25% on the pair of shoes I was getting so point less. If you value your money DO NOT SPEND IT HERE.
Appalling,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,DPD failed to deliver my parcel and lied about having called at my address (they hadn't). Instead they left the parcel at a drop point, which I'll have to travel to. I contacted Nike via chatline to complain - complete waste of time as I seemed to be trying to communicate with a robot?! So DPD are letting down customers, reflecting badly on Nike, and Nike's customer service is non-existent
Appalling returns experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Appalling returns experience. After confirming that the courier would pickup any returns from my house I ordered a number of items. Being told by nike they don't like using their own preferred courier DPD and I should use Royal Mail. I now have to lug 4 large boxes to the post office for the items I don't want. Really poor experience

Amazing service,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Amazing service I recently bought some Nike airs for my daughter and they were great quality. I also had to send them back because of the wrong sizing, they easily refunded and we got our money back. They lasted a long time and were real and great shoes, she loves them!

Left a comment on Facebook and no response and can’t contact via phone. Absolutely disgusting service Order number: C01127885912Estimated delivery was 15/11 and it’s now 30/11 and still not here
Absolutely disgraceful customer service…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely disgraceful customer service received today. I called on the 29th of November to ask why the soles of the trainers I ordered weren't white as advertised on your website. I was asked to send a photo which I did and was told,  yes there's something wrong with them.The girl I spoke to said she'd arrange an exchange which she did but I asked her for an Evri returns label / QR code because I work full time and can't get to a post office.She said she had emailed me the code. I got to the shop today,  opened the email to find she'd sent me a post office return label which I had to print.I called customer services and was told that Nike only accept returns back via the post office - this took 20 mins to discover!!!She then said I could return the trainers to my nearest store..... in London which is well over an hour's drive from my house!!I asked for a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience and was told that Nike only issue promotion codes!!!I explained that I didn't want any other products and that I wanted some money off the trainers I'd purchased to which I was told "Nike don't do that." I got to the post office (on my afternoon off work) only to find that the QR code on the returns label isn't the one they need to print off a label.I called customer services back and was told that he would cancel my return and that I could start it again to get a QR code.I have no more time off until February from work and these trainers are a present for my son for Christmas. So... Please tell me how I am supposed to send these back now?The whole returns process is an utter joke!!!I requested to be put through to the complaints team and eas told there isn't one.I requested to be put through to a manager and was told that wasn't possible and that if a manager wanted to then I would get a call back!!!So Nike... where do I go from here? Social media?  News papers? CEO? You tell me.Currently you have my money and I have a pair of trainers that you supplied that are defective.
Wow what a real disappointment the help…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Wow what a real disappointment the help line are. I purchased 3 tops and they came up too big so I returned the good and put all 3 hoody is in the same package. I had a confirmation email saying that one Hoody has been received and the refund will be processed but no confirmation with the other two when I contacted the helpline they explained that they had received them and that they need to check them before they will send me an email confirming that receive them and then the refund will be processed between five and nine days. I asked him can I have an email confirming you received all 3 tops and was told no they could not, and it will take up to 7 days for them to check the other two hoodies before they process a refund. I ask why one top was checked and the refund is gonna be processed at the same bag, the other two tops hadn’t been checked why is it gonna take seven days when they’ve opened it all at the same time why can’t they check it all at the same time I was told I can’t help you there is nothing we can do you’ll have to wait seven days for the tops to be checked and then another nine days for a refund . Well merry bloody Christmas, these were Christmas presents that I wanted to originally exchange and purchased a a smaller size But My presents will not be coming from nike now.very very very disappointed. I would  advise not to buy from the Nike store online because the refunds and the processing of it all, it’s an absolute headache. And I’m still not sure if I’m getting my money back ????

No refund,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If you want a refund go through chargeback with your bank or PayPal dispute. They promise refund but never give it.Disgusting company
Told to file a police report,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Spent thousands of dollars with Nike and I’m repaid by them telling me to file a police report for items they failed to deliver.  They said it was delivered to my garage but I don’t have a garage and they used the picture as proof.  These guys are a terribly inept and scammy company and I won’t be using them again

Terrible quality control and customer service. Just hope you gamble on the right shoes.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Just bought a pair of newly released Jordan 1s for my daughter for Xmas, thought I did quite well after they sold out pretty quickly on Nikes ‘SNKRS’ site. That’s until they arrived… I paid £164.95 for this highly sought after trainer to find a horrendous shiny glue mark across the front of the toe on one shoe. Clearly no quality control, and when I ring Nike they basically don’t care and just say send them back. That’s great apart from the fact that if I do that I now can’t deliver on my daughters Xmas present. It’s not hard to make sure your products are fit for sale and meet quality standards. So I either send them back and have to let my daughter down or give a substandard product that’s just cost £165. Unbelievable and terrible service.

Ordered items from nike to b lost by…,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Ordered items from nike to b lost by everi had to wait an extra week before they couldn't locate the parcel, tried to say it had been attempted delivery with Everi which was false, then gave me a refund which I had no choice to take, decided to order different items from nike because they gave me 10% off for them to ship with DPD and they do the same. Nike need to choose better delivery companies and as a member of nike is shocking
Terrible customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible customer service. Tried to place an order last night with an eligible discount code. Purchase wouldn't proceed after payment. Got the circle of doom whilst processing. Trued for over an hour. Contacted today and not interested. Code has expired at 8am this morning! Totally unhelpful.
Website crashed resulting in duplicate orders but no cancellation allowed.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Loved nike products but the website is trash. I tried ordering a jacket but the website crashed and resulted in duplicate orders. I thought the orders weren't successful and took a nap. I woke up to find that the order confirmation emails were sent sometime after and I missed the 30 minutes mark to cancel online. I appealed to two customer agents but was unsuccessful. Then I went to initiate returns for both purchases but had not received any return labels. I checked with the customer agent who told me to wait 24 hours. Seriously for anyone who wants to buy via Nike website - DON'T.
Trainers attempted to be delivered last…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Trainers attempted to be delivered last Thursday 24/11/2022 to wrong address, DPD took picture and posted delivered even though not to the correct address. Neighbour told the driver it was the incorrect address who then took the trainers back but didn’t update DPD website until Saturday that trainers being returned to Nike. Now Nike have received/refunded me but now don’t have my size. Complained to Nike might as well talk to a brick wall. Rubbish service from DPD & Nike.
Great experience from The Netherlands,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,I'm from The Netherlands and ordered shoes from nike.com and also did a return.Delivery was fast, ordered on saturday and arrived on monday. The shoes were too small, so I called them by phone (yes they actually have real humans to answer the phone) and we arranged to get me the right size. The person on the phone could see the current stocks which was also helpful. They emailed me a return label to return the shoes that were too small, used the box in which they came and brought it to the post office, and 3 days later I already had my money back on my bank account.To be honest I tried the shoes out a bit, but they said it was not a problem. I also expected the refund process to take some time, but when the refund was transferred almost immediately, I decided to write a short review here to express my appreciation.Would definitely buy again and there are no worries returning and getting your money back. I'm a very happy customer.
Customer service is non existent,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered a pair of trainers in a plum colour through the app. It has worked fine previously, easy ordering and quick delivery, but this time one of the shoelaces had a hole all the way through. Since it has the same plum colour as the shoe it is not easily replaced. The shoe is now sold out in both stores and online. I tried calling customer service but they couldn’t just send me a new pair of shoelaces. Only option was to return the shoes, get a full refund and reorder, which unfortunately is not possible, because it is sold out everywhere. I never would have expected such a lousy service considering their prices.

Nike guarantee a waste of time,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nikes guarantee a waste of space. I'm 68 Yr old. Don't jog or do much and have bought Nikes for decades, but £135 trainers developed a hole in both soles within 15 months. Never experienced this before. Returned them for reduced refund of £30 as I didn't have receipt anymore.. THEY HAD THE CHEEK TO REFUSE BY SAYING 'WEAR AND TEAR',even though the rest of the trainers were like new. Well that's it for me now... From now on it will be Adidas, Fila or whoever for a more realistic price of £30-40. Just go to Sports Direct. NIKE can now take a running jump
Website issues.,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Have purchased custom trainers from the Nike website in the past, and was really happy with them and the service provided. I have tried logging in to do the same again, but I am being told I do not have an account, which is confusing. I re-registered and spent a while designing my custom trainers. However I have been trying to add these trainers into the basket to purchase for 3 days now with no joy whatsoever. I even tried adding a random item into the basket just to see if there was an issue just with the custom items but still not successful. I have messaged Nike but not yet had a response. Unfortunately I have decided to purchase from a different brand.
Garbage experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Garbage experience.  Nike advertises 60% off before you give your email, then hardly anything is eligible for the promotion or it doesnt work at all and you get an error code.  Pure garbage.  I guess Nike has enough money, they clearly don't want mine.

Absolutely shocking @ warning @ please read,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely unbelievable - read this @@ Sent my 2 items back for a refund , used the printed returns label with a tracking number , kept the proof of postage , tracking also shows delivery at the warehouse… but no , because they haven’t scanned the items and they have been lost there is nothing they can and cannot refund me , they have had an “investigation” and and cannot process my money back / so they have the items totalling £221 , I have full proof of postage and delivery and will not refund me as they didn’t scan them. How the hell is this my fault ?? Had to do a charge back claim with my bank . The customers service agents are useless pathetic robotic morons working from some god awful 3rd world call centre / absolute lunatics , I’ll never ever use the Nike website again , disgusting behaviour and experience. Seriously consider buying from them as many of these reviews demonstrate they are an inadequate company and only care about making money and not resolving issues with customers . Come on Sort out these customer service agents also , do we really have to do deal with this nowadays ? One of them couldn’t even string a sentence together , just about managed to say hello and sorry over and over , waste of time and annoying. I’ll charge this money back and I hope Nike gets a black mark against their name in the process as I believe this happens on charge back claims.

Object to overseas despatch,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The Nike product is always of high quality - wanted the Spurs 3rd shirt for our grandson, out of stock at Spurs, and in fact better value online with name/premier badge. What gets me, is I do not want to participate in (presumably) airfreight of single items from mainline Europe - I buy from a UK website, expect delivery from the UK. Also leads to multiple tracking delivery dates as the item passes through customs. So -1 star for delivery from abroad, and -3 stars for for three different delivery days!

So unprofessional return process,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I bought a nike dunk shoe, when I was out traveling. Already after one time wearing the shoe it was creasing in a way I have not seen before. 1. The process of getting shipping label and initiate the return was very bad, no information reference number. After sending I didn't get any updat from nike, even I could see the package was received by them i will get gift card if they see it as defect (3-4 weeks processing time).2. After they couldn't find my shoe, and made me super nervous about their bad overview of the whole process. 3. After that they wanted me to send proff that I have sent it. 4. At this point it's 12 weeks after and they confirm that I will get gift now. And says it will take additional 4-5 weeks. Someone from nike please get this sorted. I am still waiting

I have called about 5 times spoken to different people, even given them my IBAN and BIC for them to make a transfer manually but still no refund. There is no complaints procedure I have asked for call backs for managers to ring me but nothing. Awful awful awfulllllllll customer service and I am STILL waiting for a refund!!!
Uses UPS courier,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Waited nearly a month for my item, shipped from CHINA with UPS. UPS are terrible unsure why Nike uses them. Delivery date changed by UPS and now they’ve taken it to some access point because the courier didn’t want to do their job. Nike and UPS are both 🚮.

Delayed delivery not here on time,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Sent me an email to say my delivery will be up to 7 days late , it was ment to be a birthday present now it won’t be here on time..for this they sent me a 25percent of code just for today so basically they want me to buy something today because only get 25percent of for today only…actual joke.
Nike SNKRS raffle, winning is not a sure win.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,If anyone else here ever tried entering the raffle on SNKRS for limited editions, you would understand how awfully difficult it is. And to win it? It felt like winning the lottery. But how about this, couple hours later I got an email that the order (after winning that nearly impossible to enter raffle) is cancelled because it is out of stock?When I contacted the customer service, the reply was the stock was out when my order entered, meaning Nike already sold the stock to elsewhere before the winners of the draw can even get to it? Shouldn’t a predetermined amount of stock be allocated for this raffle prior to the draw? It just blows my mind how there is a draw of which the prize is not even available from start?
Bad order experience,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,I ordered a pair of shoes with Nike.com and the experience has been really 'meh'.1. The order tracking was unreliable: information on the order page was not updated, the email notification "order shipped" was sent after the order was delivered, and I did not receive "delivered order" notification in time to ensure I could pick up the package so it wouldn't be stolen.2. The support team was not able to provide more details on the order than the non-fuctional order page; I would not blame this on a support specialist as I think they might not have the needed information. However, overall it was a disappointing experience.3. Support chat is bugged: I was in the middle of the chat with a customer support specialist; they told me something like "please wait a minute, I'll get back to you" and the chat was closed due to me being inactive.4. Shipping is very slow - I was expected much speedier delivery from Nike; in the future, I'd prefer to order from a reseller instead or choose another brand.
Awful customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered a LA Lakers top for my daughter. She liked the big black zip feature and the top which arrived did not have the thick black zip across the jumper. We complained and said the item was no longer in stock and were offered a 10% discount off a future item. We asked to speak to a manager as wanted a discount off this order not a future order as the error was with Nike. The customer advisor James then ended the chat. Awful service. AVOID AVOID AVOID
Awful service had nothing but hassle…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful service had nothing but hassle was awaiting a niketec for a month cancelled order after weeks of waitinj and went somewhere else reputable, still waiting on refund terrible service from Nike this online chat help is hopeless, awaiting a manager calling actually was beginning to think it's a con, how can such a huge company have such awful service and get away with it.
Good shoes all in all,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Good shoes all in all. Still have pairs from 6 years ago still in good condition. Looking forward to new ones!
Refused refund even with evidence.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Returned 2 items the same day in separate parcels have had 1 refunded and then told the other was just an empty box 😂 bare in mind I re ordered the item I returned in a smaller size because they were too big and have the tracking number and all the evidence and have been flat out refused a refund because they are money hungry freaks who deserve no oxygen.
Missing item told no refund,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Order 17 items from Nike that were all shipped in separate packages. One package arrived supposed to contain 9 items but only had 8. Having called up about the situation I was then emailed and told I was wrong and the package had been delivered. I then emailed back explaining the package did arrive but 1 item was missing. I was then told that the warehouse team had confirmed the item wasn’t missing and that the weight of the parcel was correct (even though only a T-shirt minimal weight was missing). I have asked for prood if this and had no reply yet. I was told to contact law enforcement for the missing T-shirt even though the package was sealed. What a joke
Bought some Nike pro leggings for my…,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Bought some Nike pro leggings for my daughter for Christmas.Ordering to delivery went smoothly and the item itself is great.
Ordered trainers on the 12th Nov for a…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered trainers on the 12th Nov for a run I had the following weekend, still no delivery! Nike are cheap and use the worst courier Evri that you get no response from! Evri stated a road incident 4 days ago with no update, that must be one big road incident! So poor of Nike to use this service. I couldn’t even cancel using the Nike chat app until 10 days after purchase!! What the hell!?
For a billion dollar company,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,For a billion dollar company. Costumer service sucks so bad. Bad phone connection can’t here what they saying. Very bad service.
Useless service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered some trainers on 4th Nov for my daughters birthday the week after. They used Evri to deliver. On 6th Nov (when I was in) I got a message saying that had a problem delivering and a photo of the inside of a car sat outside my house?? I've been trying to sort using their online chat as I still haven't got the trainers. The online support is useless. I was told "remember to smile" after expressing my disappointment. Just awful.
Terrible website,Rated 2 out of 5 stars,Terrible website - doesn't tell you until cart level its an international shipment, then no where does it tell you currency so because coming from International I am worried its in USD not AUD, Chat took too long to answer simple question - a simple AUD next to the price would have saved me heaps of time
The product is good,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,The product is good, just fall in love with them!!

Like always they are very good in…,Rated 4 out of 5 stars,Like always they are very good in branding but I think the quality of shoes got degraded lastly anyway I still like nike
I made a error,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I made a error, I didn’t check the reviews before placing an order.What a muppet I am🤦‍♂️Anyway placed order over a week ago No email confirmation to say delivery on the way, just called spoke to a very nice chap who said “sorry several times and told me that he’s going to refund which could take up to 9 days before I receive it” I said can’t I just have the items I’ve ordered, he said no we’ve lost them! Ok I said just re send a new order, he said he can’t do that but he can refund and that I would have to place a new order.Now for a large profitable company like Nike this is well below good customer service.Sack the manager in charge and sort out.
Good luck getting your refund...,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I've been waiting since the 2nd September for my refund. Each time i contact customer services i am told a different excuse and that they will fix it and issue the refund. The refund never arrives. At this stage the Ombudsman are looking like my only avenue to get my £100 back.
Incompetent fiasco,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike choose courier Evri for costs yet the courier are useless and uncontactable u less you pay a premium and you have to contact Nike yet they can't find anything out and low and. Ehold they can't hear from Evri... Not called back when advised I was. Jan is currently looking into this for me but so far I am not  holding out much hope considering its been days and no one knows what's happening. What has happened to Nike? Last purchase I will ever make with Nike if they do not sort TODAY.
Bad service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 2 items on the 31st October , contacted them 10 days later to ask where my order was to be told it hadn’t been shipped yet. I then requested a refund and heard nothing since. Absolute joke never ordering again all I want is a refund on my items that never arrived
Web site showed a 25% discount code,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Web site showed a 25% discount code, but when I tried to use they said it expired Otherwise Nike is overpriced poor quality AVOID
Abysmal service from a well known brand.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered two pairs of shoes, white huaraches and black huaraches along with two club fleece tracksuits, now, these are very common items and were listed as in stock when I placed my order on the the 8th of November 2022. The items in total cost me £364 which was taken from my accounts immediately after placing the order. I received my order number and then after an hour so saw that the order information page was reading as “preparing shipment” this all seemed well and good until I checked the next day and it still said “preparing shipment.” Okay, I thought, one or two days to pick the items and wrap them up ready for shipping isn’t too bad, I can deal with that, so I check back the next day and the next and the next, each day saying the same thing thing. The order was expected to arrive on the 11th. When I tried to contact Nike about it through the useless online chat service I received no help whatsoever, they palmed me off saying that they can’t do anything as they don’t know anything about anything at all and it’s their policy to make me wait 3-5 days for any information with regards to my order status. All I can say is that I’ll never shop with Nike again, infact I’ll probably sell the gear second hand and stop supporting this shambolic excuse for a brand.
Terrible service and online experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Terrible service and online experience. Another large company that think they don't need to care about individuals because they make enough from their brand name anyway.
I ordered a like $400+ worth of…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered a like $400+ worth of clothes/shoes, then the next day cancelled my order. No call, just an email saying “we had to cancel your order” with no explanation. After being hung up on 3 times immediately after holding, I get someone who is actually willing to help (75% failure rating) then I had to go thru and reorder everything, apply the discount they gave me for being terrible, and I paid thru a different method (Apple Pay) the second time. Next day, same thing cancelled it again. Keep in mind they’re KEEPING A HOLD ON MY CARD the whole time. So they have almost $1000 of my money, and see no problems keeping it for 10 days, when ZERO services were rendered. It’s basically robbery. They offer nothing as far as reconciliation. They’re just a sh!t show, run by sh!t ppl. Buy Vans instead.
20 Ls and get EA,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Firstly the whole 20 Ls and an instant EA..or so they claim, which wasn’t the case so false advertising. As for the whole back dooring situation and trying too prevent it. Why not continue with your tirade of bans but ban those who have early pair’s before release . They’re all on YouTube boasting about them, surely you have the power to enforce the sales n the date of sales to companies just like the movie n gaming industry who will not allow shipping or purchases before release and if the gamer does manage to get a copy early they can face a ban so why can’t you Nike just simply enforce the same power and penalise those who have early releases and ban them from SNKRS permanently which may prevent them from buying early pairs which may prevent back dooring or slow it down or simply make more shoes, they’ll sell out but supply n demand I suppose.. less shoes equals demand.. but isn’t that you creating the problem.
Ordered a pair of "air force 1 by you"…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered a pair of "air force 1 by you" back in August so after checking the nike app and still seeing "awaiting shipment" for the last 3 months I contacted them, I was told that the shoes had been delivered, I didn't get them so god only knows where they are, they knew they was in the wrong as they have now given me a full refund and a measly 15% off voucher which is totally meanless as I won't be buying through Nike Town again, the company has gone downhill fast, avoid like the plague.
Garbage store = Nike.com store,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Garbage store ! I was a big fan of the brand till I have experience with their official store. Trash site that make me nervous and angry. 10 times canncelation in a row. Support tell me to wait to restock and when I order while it is avalible they cancel my order 10 times in one and hlaf week ! Worst experience I had with e-shop ever ! When you write to support they will ping pong you between Nike.com support and eShop World support which is one worse than other.
Shocking Lack of Coordination & Support,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I spent a fair amount of time putting together my first pair of custom shoes and submitted these on the 19th October to be delivered to a collection point near my house.I was obviously a bit excited when I got the email on the 28th October saying my trainers were ready, ahead of the expected shipping date of the 10th November.The tracker then updated, saying that "The parcel was refused by the receiver and will be returned to the sender" so I phoned Nike and was told "don't worry, your shoes won't be ready yet so this must have been a shipping error"I was advised to wait until the 10th November, which I almost did, except today (08th November) I decided to check up on the order only to be told that I'd have to re-order. No one can tell me where the shoes went, just that I'll have to have a refund processed within 7-10 working days and having waited 3 whole weeks I have to re-order and pay again. Great job on losing a customer.

I made an order on the 7th September…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I made an order on the 7th September (paid £147) for 3 items. I received one of the 3 items I ordered and then a second parcel containing only a baby grow (18m-24m) when my youngest child is 10! I sent the wrong item back after contacting nike via live chat to explain I haven’t received two items and sent proof of postage as requested. 3 months later and 7 different live chats and phone calls I’ve not received my items or my money back. Customer Service is the worst I’ve ever experienced. Every time I’ve asked what’s going on they keep fobbing me off until I think they believe will just give up complaining. I’m owed two expensive items and I’d like to know what has gone wrong. Yet it’s nigh on impossible to formally complain. Their products might be good but their rubbish service and lack of respect for their paying customers should put you off. Do not order from nike.
The costumer service garbage,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The costumer service garbage . Bought a Nike shoes for more than 200$ That fall apart in two months and son can’t wear it any more. Called what they call a customer service center were it should be called a customer punishment center. They did not offer any thing. They want to see the bad shoes in person, wants to mail that $200 shoe back to the store where I pay the shipping and recommended insurance so they can inspect it and make there decision about it!! Seriously Nike!! I trusted ur product, did not have a problem paying for it that hard earned $200 and u do not trust a picture from a damaged product to be emailed to you!! The Rebacca that I guys hired at the customer service to be the manager clearly said it is the costumers’ problem they trusted Nike they said. Well bye bye Nike I have a very good reason now to not pay a penny for any of ur products specially with a market full of other brands that better quality and customer service
Undelivered trainers - dpd pickshop useless,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I ordered some trainers on the 30th of October, they came within a few days but failed delivery as I wasn't in therefore my parcel went to dpd pick up shop, two days later I go to collect my parcel and the shop keeper(who was short of a few cells) just said barcode and you get parcel after a short while trying to tell him my parcel isn't here I contact nike, they said he had sent it back although i had 5days to collect so I asked for an exchange to be put in place so I could have my trainers as soon as. Now.. 7th November still no trainers and just had email confirmation ill be getting a refund. Rang nike to ask what's going on and the women was short with me and basically said tuff you'll have to order them again now.Really not happy!Arshavin food and wine dpd pickup shop, if your parcel goes there forget about it!
Launch event fiasco,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I’m a Nike member and order lots of items throughout the year. For the past two years I’ve set my alarm, logged on very early to take advantage of the pre sale of Air Jordan’s that my daughter has now asked for, for 2X Christmas gifts and 2X birthday gifts. Never able to get! Today, I did the same, set my alarm, got in the queue early, got the trainers in my basket, only to be told my card is invalid! This is the same message I get every time at the launch event. Obviously a system error, as my card is good enough for the rest of the year! I contact customer services who tell me they’ll feed this back. I fed this back the last couple of times and I’m still in the same position. I’m told it’s a fair process yet it’s not very fair if I keep being told my card is invalid when it’s not. Sort your systems out Nike! Very disappointed again.
It's legit..,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,It's legit... bought AF1's twice shipping from Netherlands 🇳🇱 arrived in South Africa🇿🇦. Aramex is the best also
Men’s hoodies,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Men’s hoodies I just wanna say they need to fire the sh!t out of their hoodie designer because the size of the arm on a men’s hoodie is that size of a damn pant leg it’s literally so wide like why, it just ruins the whole style of the hoodie.
Not happy,Rated 3 out of 5 stars,Not happy, received my order with the bag ripped open. And the product inside not even in a plastic bag for extra protection. These paper bags needs to be changed because you have couriers like evri that don't take care of packages and it gets ripped open. The courier had to ask at the door if there is supposed to be one thing in the bag because it was fully open. Change your bags.
The Collapse of a Giant..,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My original order for a pair of Air Force 1 was placed on 25th October. The email stated that they would be delivered on 29th Oct 2022. However, on 28th Oct, I noticed that the payment was back on my account. Delivery day arrives, but the trainers didn't. Someone at Nike had cancelled my order (this was confirmed by my bank). As it's a birthday present, I re-ordered, but this time I wanted to pick them up a Nike store. The email said delivery date will be 3rd November.  I enter the store, provide my delivery details, NO ITEM IN STORE! P***ed but no panic! Later I contacted Nike Customer Services and I'm told "They'll be there tomorrow!" It's not acceptable, but hey I tried to be patient. I checked the delivery status (which wasn't available yesterday), and the F**king shoes are STILL IN BRUSSELS! Are you kidding me!! For the last twenty years (or so), I have sadly watched the demised of this once great brand, and it's really sad! From the poor size restructuring of the clothes (where joggers are coming up short), to the poor staff product knowledge, care and empathy. Clearly not the Nike, that I used to spend ALL my money on in the 90's. That Nike had a feel-good factor about it. This what's here now, is a Horror show! I now have to find a replacement birthday gift, as this will not arrive in time. 71% One Star reviews! Is this Really Nike?!
STOP USUING DPD!!!,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,STOP USUING DPD!!!Dpd are the worst couriers about. Constantly lying about delivery attempts. I Will not order from Nike online until you've changed from these sh** couriers.(USE PAACK)
Outrageous bad,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Outrageous bad. Nike simply sent a notification, that shipment has been delivered. NOT. It is not possible to contact Nike support, no e-mail or contact form, only a phone, that does not answer. Only option is to make my bank withdraw payment. Unbelievable.
Terrible Service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Nike Customer Service is such garbage... at least I finally have a good enough reason to stop buying from this terrible brand. The first time I tried to talk to them some jerk named Tom just kept me waiting for 5 minutes and automatically ended the chat. The second time I had someone named Jennifer and she just started replying slower and slower when I asked questions and kept me hanging on like she was still trying to figure something out. Super annoying!
Zero Concern For the Customers,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,My order was returned on day of delivery due to missing address information on the label they created. Rather than resending the order, I was told I had to order another one and would not offer the new order to be expedited.  Now I’m waiting for them to receive the order that was sent back so I can get a refund.  So much for customer care and I would like to add that supervisors are unavailable to customers.  In addition, giving feedback on the Nike website leads to absolutely zero response.  Hence, I’m now an Adidas customer.  I just want my money back and from reading the recent reviews here, I’m very concerned.

Absolute Joke,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Absolutely applaud with customer service! If was a zero rating that is what I'd give! Ordered a pair of trainers received two different sizes in one box god forbid me for not having a printer! Talked to about 15different customer service people via the chat that all tell a different story No help what so ever JOKE!!!!!
Awful website and customer service - If i could give zero stars i would,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I could not purchase the trainers i wanted. They have a huge IT/Website issue - for a company as big as nike it is pretty shocking. Error codes keep popping up.  Customer service are from abroad and do not speak clearly with really bad connection and just unhelpful. Customer service kept pausing me as didnt understand the error code on my payment screen and could NOT place my order over the phone! Pretty rubbish service overall.
Exceptional Service,Rated 5 out of 5 stars,Ordered a pair of trainers which weren't suitable, I returned however there was an issue on the courier side. Customer service were very swift to resolve.

Nike does not send or cancel my order,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I bought shoes from nike website 16 days ago. They were supposed to ship it in 2 days however they did not ship. also they do not give any information about the shipment. I tried to cancel my order but it is more than a week and they did not cancel my order. So technically they stole my money. never buy anything from nike website if you want your product or money.

But despite DPD telling me they were ready to collect from my chosen delivery point, DPD has no idea what has happened to them. Called Nike three times very little help and had to chase DPD myself. Now Nike customer service expect me to wait min 9 days before we talk about a resolution. Its mad I have paid for goods not delivered and I have to wait?

Don't order from Nike unless u want a wild goose chase.,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Only give one star as u have to to leave this review, appears by other reviews I'm not the only to have faced a vulgar service, customer skills are nil and void, they don't care one iota, repeat themselves won't answer your questions, and are the worst I've ever come across. Vulgar vulgar company.
Overall pretty crap experience,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Overall pretty crap experience. The nike shoes started to fall apart after just 3 months, a refund was offered but not given. Replacement shoes were sent next day delivery, got lost in the post, arrived 14 days later. I'm now left with another pair of the "fall apart" shoes which I don't wish to use, cause no doubt they will also fall apart in 90 days or less. Customer Service were more than rubbish. Not what you'd expect from a premium brand. Such a shame.
Useless customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,The AirPods popped in a pair of Next % running shoes. It’s been 6 weeks and multiple live chat sessions and I still haven’t received even a returns label.The staff keep fobbing me off. I’ve raised two complaints and neither have been felt with.Nike customer service is a joke. It’s a disgrace that a multi national corporation treats their customers with such contempt.

Poor quality, even worse customer service,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,I purchased a pair of vapourmax that I have only worn 5/6 times, they still look brand new they have had such little wear. The bubble in both heels has deflated, leaving the shoes unwearable. It falls just outside of the 2 year warranty period. Eventually I found a way to contact them, no level of interest in the faulty item and very unhelpful. £170 for a pair of shoes that only lasted a few wears… I won’t be purchasing again!
Worst customer service I have ever had…,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Worst customer service I have ever had to deal with. I send in my vapormax under warranty less than a year. I was to get a refund for the sneakers is what their email said in 7-10 days. They tried to refund my money but could not. Never contacted me about the issue this is almost a month later I remembered, checked my account and nothing. Get in contact with them and all they offer me is a nike gift card in the amount I paid, will not replace the item under warranty. Item cost more now so they will not replace it. Elite nike team are rude and not professional at all.
Awful costumer services,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Awful costumer services. I was scammed by Nike. I ordered a pair of football boots and a socks and I only received the socks. I sent them a video me opening the box at the time of delivery and they are still struggling to refund me or send me a pair of boots. It has been 4 weeks
Half order,Rated 1 out of 5 stars,Ordered 2 items from nike online for delivery on the 3rd of Oct 2022 ,received one of my items with the other to follow , on the 12th of October I received a message from the delivery company that my parcel was ready to pick up from a premier store in blackpool , I rang nike cs to be reassured that the lady I spoke to had arranged for the parcel to be delivered to my home , then today I received a further message today 17th of oct saying today is the last chance to pick up my parcel from the premier store named last week , so obviously I rang again , the cs operator stated that I would have to receive a refund as I can't get the parcel redelivered , he said they had tried to deliver the parcel but couldn't for whatever reason , I had already told them in the previous phone call that I am disabled and housebound and could not get to the store or anywhere else for that matter and I live 50 miles away from my family, I was also offered 15% discount for the inconvenience , which I turned down , after the call I remembered that I'd had a delivery last week and when I went to the door the delivery driver had two parcels , after giving me a parcel he knocked on my neighbours door at which point I came back into my home and thought nothing of it ,I didn't open the parcel until the next day as it was a Christmas present ,So there was no rush , when I did open it , it turned out to be chocolates,on checking the name and address it was my neighbours parcel ,immediately I realised the driver got the parcels mixed up, on speaking to my neighbour I found out she didn't know anything about a delivery as she was at work, what I didn't expect was that I wouldn't get my parcel at all , Why would I accept a 15% discount off the nike online store when I can't get what I ordered to begin with , first and last time I use nike online
